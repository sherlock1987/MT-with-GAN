thank you .
1.@@ 5 million .
it &apos;s a lot .
thank you very much , guys .
i &apos;m tom .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help you .
we &apos;re losing them .
oh , my god !
yeah . okay .
... yet .
thank you guys .
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
is that all ?
thank you .
we &apos;re taking off .
solar technology is ...
three times out of 10 .
oh , my god .
we love entertain@@ ment .
we love innovation .
from se@@ attle ...
what does this mean ?
this is not ...
go home to where ?
we were poor .
what does it mean ?
which was a@@ wes@@ ome .
it &apos;s interesting .
after one week .
that &apos;s your only chance .
a long time , yes .
music as language .
yes , so to speak .
it is possible though .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
you need time .
it goes fast .
that &apos;s wrong .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , hell@@ o .
the sun is ris@@ ing .
which is sing@@ ing .
this is hard .
nice one .
ta@@ -@@ da !
that was us .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
does that sound good ?
here it is .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
i don &apos;t know .
thank you . thank you .
like twice over .
this is ste@@ phen watt .
you could see manhattan .
it is gener@@ ic .
so where do we go ?
here is the video .
you can enter inside it .
i was ex@@ posed to him .
they all matter .
so they know everything .
it has sensor@@ s .
i &apos;ve got a question .
i was ama@@ zed .
this would have been fine .
ban is blan@@ k .
play &apos;s essential .
but you know what ?
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
oh , that guy .
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
very different notion .
so , you can do it .
how enga@@ ged you are .
there &apos;s no normal .
so this is for real .
that &apos;s very good .
quite a few more .
he answers the door .
why not live longer ?
explore .
it &apos;s not a country .
1,000 , very good .
well she was back all right .
let me give you an example .
what will these people want ?
hey , why not ?
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
and i thought about that .
but i car@@ ried on with my work .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
and they did .
and i went back to work .
so what happens here ?
this is happening to us today .
i don &apos;t believe that .
why do we do that ?
okay . thank you very much .
and that &apos;s important .
so what happened here ?
centers were establi@@ shed .
i don &apos;t know .
hu@@ h . hang on a moment .
so how does it happen ?
so meet al .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
they &apos;re using their hands .
one of two things is going to happen .
sc@@ ore them again .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
because , you know something ?
thanks so much .
and it must go back .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s our present .
yes , milli@@ seconds .
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
we can do it differently .
they have similar principles .
totally in@@ efficient .
what is the media today ?
that &apos;s efficient .
the whole environmental discussion .
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
what would you say ?
why does this happen in the first place ?
we can do that .
just do your job .
good job ! yeah !
what do you want to do ? &quot;
thank you very much .
this was the result .
can we do this differently ?
all that interests me .
this is the last one .
yes , that &apos;s possible .
fly away , c@@ at .
so let &apos;s have a look .
yes , hell@@ o .
that was all .
there &apos;s nothing po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in it .
and those days are gone .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
and this was fascinating .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
and so , we need energy mira@@ cles .
that &apos;s super important .
can i be honest ?
b@@ g : thank you .
they &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
sound familiar ? right .
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
and i was an artist .
pretty good , right ?
that &apos;s the system .
what a fish .
the first two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
nothing will happen .
yes , hell@@ o .
that is do@@ able .
len@@ to , slow .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
not very sustainable .
let &apos;s call him don .
i actually am .
what did they do ?
these guys make money .
he liked it very much .
so here it is .
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , everybody .
here you see the city .
so what happened years after@@ ward ?
who are these cou@@ s@@ ins ?
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
she did it in secret .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
it feels great .
you can see the water coming .
aw@@ w , thank you .
an almost iden@@ tical structure .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
i don &apos;t think so .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
we made this game in 2007 .
so , i &apos;m going to wra@@ p up now .
i want to ask a question .
thank you .
but it gets worse .
be a ment@@ or .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
some have come and gone .
maybe 10 times more .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i swe@@ ar .
and it even got better .
that does not hold for emotions .
after only one trip .
my hun@@ ches again .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
and then it went international .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
he is my grand@@ father .
what am i going to look at ?
okay , a bit more .
or is it photograph@@ y ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
so here &apos;s another example .
but there &apos;s another thing .
so let me rec@@ ap .
this is an old study .
yeah . all right .
that is a fantastic question .
j@@ k : both .
turn the camera off .
that &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour .
that &apos;s a great question .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
is that your opini@@ on ?
the first : cut .
my name is am@@ it .
and i grew up in india .
keep going . have fun .
and the answer is no .
so i made one .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
now , what does that mean ?
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
but that &apos;s not protection .
th@@ ank@@ fully , right ?
it won &apos;t .
does anyone see anything specific ?
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
give pe@@ e a chance .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have b@@ ones .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
and that means there are too many of us .
but where are we of use ?
it was different in china .
but the wrong things .
that means that instead of having individual memor@@ ies , we have standar@@ dis@@ ed , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memor@@ ies , onto which we can atta@@ ch our personal memor@@ ies .
you make compar@@ is@@ ons .
and i always have been .
why not think about it this way ?
very expensive real e@@ state .
here &apos;s another example .
they actually hurt .
why do this ?
i am a writer .
most people here have heard of them .
how do we humans actually function ?
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted .
and this is fe@@ li@@ x , actually .
inv@@ enting his own narra@@ tive .
you can see this at the bottom .
thanks for listening .
the work of the interpre@@ ter .
well , what does that mean ?
people were going crazy .
the data came back .
we need to get the message out .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
what do you think happened then ?
and i understand that .
and why is it true ?
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
first , we &apos;ve got population .
his name is paul off@@ it .
i &apos;m totally with you .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
yes , there it is .
but it hadn &apos;t .
so , what do we have to do ?
he had had the experience .
what needed to be done ?
that &apos;s ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
it goes against justice .
what is the sou@@ l ?
the sou@@ l is something mental , lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z said .
what is decisi@@ ve , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s val@@ id .
we were a group of tw@@ ent@@ y people .
i &apos;m surprised .
tremend@@ ously challen@@ ging .
let &apos;s call him don too .
but what are your fish eating ?
there is no feed .
i don &apos;t love that question .
this is really cool . &quot;
have you seen these guys ?
actually , i made two more mistakes .
and then it happened again .
crisis . death . disaster .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
and many people forget this .
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
and so i did .
and i felt really good .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
there were still fis@@ hes .
we have three main groups .
we have online crimin@@ als .
priv@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
they sort of go like this .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
i represent children .
there are billions of them .
but what are we doing with it ?
and it op@@ ens up a map .
i never will forget it .
i will never forget it .
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
the only country in the world .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
what happens is this .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
the data says it all the time .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
but the point is ...
and the form has something to do with it .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
and here is a surprise .
you have not changed the story .
very sc@@ ary .
it is a completely different notion .
what should our report card look like ?
this is the one with the greatest impact .
they were seeing something ma@@ gical .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
this is a lot of volu@@ me .
finally : epi@@ c meaning .
same thing , only bigger .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
and it was a huge success .
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
who does the very best ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
want to feed the world ?
this data was not available before .
the whole building is made of water .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
first over@@ time , second .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
you saw the big peak .
and then everybody moved down .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
so you can have this cloud .
you can play with a different type .
i was in a@@ we .
that &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot boat .
so that started the journey .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
how many people would choose creativity ?
how about fit@@ ness ?
this is really exciting .
okay , we can do that .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
which one would you like the most ?
they are building an epi@@ c story .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
is it just imag@@ in@@ ary ?
now how could this come about ?
these changes are coming .
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
well , i was next .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
let &apos;s make it kog@@ i . &quot;
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
pattern recogni@@ tion should also work .
so it &apos;s a circle .
so what why ha@@ cking ?
what what happened there ?
this is a game for outside .
for example perception in this context .
does anybody know what this is ?
they really loved it .
this happened around christ@@ mas .
and then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
we are depen@@ dent on two countries .
and we absor@@ b all of it .
and so there are too many of us .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
so not like a de@@ to@@ x .
so let me re@@ mind you .
everybody needs a fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
and the answer is yes .
but i felt worse .
you could have done better .
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
that &apos;s god , you know .
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
like that , you know .
you know , is it rational ?
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and what is that thing ?
every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
because technologi@@ cally it &apos;s just not possible .
they then also say , why ?
that can &apos;t be a problem .
and here you have the graphic again .
and then pres@@ ented .
thank you for your attention .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
i wanted to support them .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
four and a half thousand people live there .
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
an au@@ ti@@ stic pu@@ pi@@ l .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
because you can train that .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
and how did you feel ?
it will start to look more and more like you .
my wife told me it .
does that make you curious ?
here you have it again .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ements about reality .
we can apply these things to other examples .
it doesn &apos;t have this sou@@ l .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
she did it for three years .
i sometimes push too hard .
i talk a lot about these issues .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
so the white lines here are population .
now we talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news here .
i mean , that was epi@@ c .
and as soon as i walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
and i got in my car and i went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
but , but , you know what ?
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit something to you .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a tech@@ no@@ pho@@ be .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
but they do the job .
and it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
and here &apos;s the thing .
why should i worry ?
and one time we caught a live one .
they were still kind of happy .
this was my first sun@@ burn .
he was actually colle@@ cting fish .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
she shares her experience with others .
so what was the next step ?
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and she &apos;s hit@@ ting a 25@@ 7 .
but there are two problems with that .
i began to feel a bit better .
slowly but sur@@ ely , it li@@ f@@ ted .
she was back and near death .
the other nur@@ se asked ma@@ tter@@ -@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and i memor@@ i@@ zed everything .
and this made me really sad .
but it was very sad .
i see this plus sign .
what other br@@ ands are like that ?
and so that &apos;s what we did .
and really you do the same thing .
it really comes from these artists .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
so this is all of the meta@@ -@@ data information .
now this is one of the images .
they called me .
and it took 18 months .
we went and looked at a site .
tell me about this world .
super@@ ior technology .
that &apos;s very ris@@ ky .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
your plant can b@@ low up .
that &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
and that worked pretty well .
he showed it to ja@@ vier .
and then some very funny things happened .
her mother raised her alone .
this is not a finished story .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
it connected those two people .
and that &apos;s nothing .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
how could we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
no had never been an option .
this picture &apos;s from there .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
so what happened on this day ?
all right , let &apos;s go .
okay , there &apos;s some .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
think about your own choices .
one is south korea .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
next would be nuclear .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
and it really changed the dynamic .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mond now .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
architec@@ ts and engineers , th@@ ank@@ fully .
and i tried something interesting .
there &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
so with that , i thank you .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and then we said , okay ,
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
he &apos;ll auto@@ matically go to the right thought .
today they &apos;re called project ex@@ ecu@@ ting organizations .
he &apos;s wa@@ sting his time on non@@ sense .
yes , here is the data .
how far would you get with that ?
and it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much .
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
so , i just started playing .
music is medicine . music changes us .
thinking , you know , two percent .
i fell out of love with this fish .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
and that can make a big difference .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
but what will come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
so , this crazy story might be true .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
we have reach@@ ed a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity . i love it .
here this lo@@ gic is expres@@ sed in this de@@ cep@@ tive dis@@ course .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
the result of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
what defin@@ es a story ?
so the cor@@ relation is low .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imag@@ ined .
so , the living give birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
we &apos;re still extremely atta@@ ched to story@@ telling as a method of information bro@@ ker@@ age .
they are usually for@@ gotten by the third term .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
i would like to prove that to you .
at least not to navi@@ gate .
to the book and to the image .
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@ c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@ ies to stone and have ero@@ ded our ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
i don &apos;t know who re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ es what .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
another very exciting phenomenon .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
and that has to do with phosp@@ hor@@ us .
was a very a very fan@@ cy project .
it causes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
we started this over 15 years ago .
sun@@ light and co2 is one method ...
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
and there are several reasons for this .
do you want them dist@@ ressed ?
the truth is more like this .
it &apos;s entirely in@@ significant .
amazing ! the machin@@ ery is kind of l@@ oud .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapi@@ dly .
this is hit@@ ting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
that image remin@@ ded me of something .
leave that up to us .
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
talk about getting by with nothing .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
do you know what en@@ vy is ?
because to me it means memory .
he was over six@@ ty at the time .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
and it will sound completely different from before .
how and what did they feel ?
the reasons for writing it .
were you ever en@@ vi@@ ous ?
something sho@@ ots through my head .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fir@@ es and are happy when the fire fl@@ ar@@ es up .
that must be our difference in age .
this this hin@@ t at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out l@@ oud .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
zero emissions , you see ?
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can win back our nutri@@ ents .
but we need this everywhere .
but totally effective , right ?
with people , it is rele@@ ased in the ur@@ ine .
i fo@@ unded an institute with this in mind .
we say sustain@@ ability in germany .
that &apos;s just about the minim@@ um .
you can show that you were there .
if you think about it , right ?
we can re-@@ inv@@ ent things all over again .
it turns out to be really difficult .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
i know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
it can know where we are .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
over here , these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
and then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
and that &apos;s a very sensi@@ ble question .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
now we do the same with air@@ planes .
and i began giving her my ra@@ p .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
but it does require a lot of planning .
and every morning i ho@@ p on it .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
and those are the neu@@ ral structures .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
her father died soon after she was born .
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
they had been pus@@ hed gene@@ tically .
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
and nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
i am a re@@ defined physi@@ cian .
and his answer was yes .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
because i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
le@@ go made it acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ eline .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
because we live on a water planet .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
in fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
you &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
the other one had a lot of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
and the family gather@@ ed .
why did i go into medicine ?
de@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
do we really want to go there ?
i went to prison -- difficult .
we &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which br@@ ands .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
it sounds sc@@ ary .
that was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
and i had to get out of town .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
we are a smaller brand .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
that &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
i like really nice clo@@ th@@ es .
you can go all the way through .
and this video is real time .
i call this &quot; sh@@ in@@ y tiger . &quot;
just be who you are .
the match begins -- sil@@ ence .
i like things that are different .
but the reality is far from it .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
he only has use of his eyes .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
isn &apos;t that a@@ wes@@ ome ?
um , my brand ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
they even can bring with them some finan@@ cing .
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
here &apos;s their ja@@ m a@@ is@@ le .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
and so we measu@@ red its motion .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
all the adults knew the risks .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundre@@ d-@@ thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
something sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed inside me .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
but then you really want to go deep .
those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very ni@@ c@@ ely together .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distribu@@ ted yet .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
thanks for you pati@@ ence .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
this is a photograph of the object .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
the bri@@ cks are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
and then what do you do with the waste ?
also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent sources .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance policy .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
they manage the process , they understand the process .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
fe@@ ast@@ ing ? i was totally conf@@ used .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
the che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t in relationships . &quot;
does anyone even know what those things are ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
how are you going to feed the world ?
it was really , really quite profound .
so , what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this ?
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
that will take place next apri@@ l .
so , this is world without oil .
what do you think happens next ?
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
this is true . i believe this .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
let me read you the ent@@ ry .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s part of our life .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
sexual re@@ production en@@ ters the picture .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
we were given very accu@@ rate data .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
there are . there always are .
not even the truth will set them free .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
do@@ sage has something to do with this .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
so , please for@@ give me .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
that is exactly what you are doing .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
we need to go far , quickly .
that might sound unusual at first .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
this is about virtu@@ ality , about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , about story@@ telling .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
from the modern to the computer society .
and just to say , what is information ?
this is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an , exactly .
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
they spe@@ ared each other .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television chan@@ nel .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
in other do@@ ma@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
these are cell phones of the future .
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we design unique elements into this .
first you see from back to front .
a language is a flas@@ h of the human spirit .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
over the h@@ ills and all that .
so you could call it the trans@@ lation of a trans@@ lation .
it &apos;s a so@@ le@@ m@@ n part .
his personal impres@@ sions of the water@@ li@@ lies .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
say what you feel .
so two cy@@ cles are created .
in two hours it &apos;s bio@@ de@@ gra@@ ded , wher@@ ever it is .
a particularly nice story , in my opini@@ on .
that &apos;s how people imagine the sou@@ l works .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes a lo@@ gic to us .
the first theor@@ em is , kl@@ aus cla@@ ims there is no sou@@ l .
that which i just pres@@ ented to you .
you put a box like this over there .
protect the environment , produce less ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
he will have to process that as the present .
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five milli@@ seconds ?
that &apos;s also a paradig@@ m shift .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
and curi@@ osity can &apos;t be learned .
then i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
but with the right design , please .
so humans can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
there is not one single tree that is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
we can support them in doing good .
the side product is clean water .
we can support them in doing good .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
so it &apos;s fe@@ eding back on itself .
they stopped us from being inspired .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
my cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
something really weird is going on here .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
i represent people on death row .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
it will get to you .
introdu@@ ce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
we worked well into each night .
i felt like anyone could do that .
he died broken by history .
i never knew him in real life .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
so i followed my hun@@ ches .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
the shor@@ es are from a different location .
it might take a moment to load .
this is a mo@@ dest little ap@@ p .
so scot@@ t gets this call .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
you always lose rare animals .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
they were ma@@ turing at five centi@@ meters .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
alone , as@@ ham@@ ed and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve .
even cat@@ s were watching this video .
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
you should ask for some of that .
i had written these crazy things .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
i do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
what will these three billion people bring ?
and i kept asking myself these questions .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
and the emer@@ g@@ . staf@@ f pulled out all the st@@ ops .
and it was what i was feeling .
he re@@ treated into sil@@ ence .
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
and that was the on@@ set of als .
these devices aren &apos;t acc@@ essi@@ ble to people . &quot;
the roof also is covered with water .
here &apos;s the building working .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
there &apos;s no in@@ sur@@ ance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
thank you guys very much . that was a@@ wes@@ ome .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
so that was the reason for the project .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
but play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
let me tell you a bit about it .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
now we see the opposite effect .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
i think this is really cool .
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
everybody appl@@ au@@ ded poli@@ tely .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vi@@ ral video , bear .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
and he had po@@ sted lots of nature videos in fact .
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel actually .
... meaning not so optimi@@ stic .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
it &apos;s completely direc@@ ted .
that &apos;s just a working ti@@ tle , by the way .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
he turns off the eng@@ ines .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
tell me a little bit about that part .
eating an entire bow@@ l of cool whi@@ p .
we talk about b@@ old , fresh .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
you brought your pictures , right ?
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is open-@@ source .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly 150 miles back .
instead , let &apos;s look to the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
she kind of set us up .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sele@@ ct government .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
they live in an environment of che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
and that generally looks like this .
pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
a third theor@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong atta@@ ch@@ ment to the idea of a sou@@ l .
these theor@@ em@@ s are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
say , there are no predic@@ tors .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
our obje@@ ctive was to simply say , okay ,
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart grid .
smart gri@@ ds are a hot top@@ ic at the moment everywhere .
and in that time you can re@@ act differently .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
can you play it in blue now ?
we object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
remember those na@@ pp@@ ies again ?
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
we need to go for more research fund@@ ing .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
the internet and its services are a mira@@ cle .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
this is something that has to get to zero .
my parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine .
my grand@@ parents pus@@ hed that number to 70 .
instru@@ ments have developed .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
in this way , every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
oh , so jes@@ us , what a thought !
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
we had to take them out , which we did .
they &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
seriously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
which is great , because we need that .
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
the flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
i could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
we don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
now i put a b@@ ass line in .
ini@@ tially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
their problem is that they have too little .
they actually make us worse off .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
re@@ power america . find out more .
and the problem is not technology itself .
imagine mo@@ z@@ art being efficient .
every foot@@ print is dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous there .
protect the environment , consu@@ me less energy .
and everything is either the pac@@ k@@ aging or the cont@@ ents .
china can make up for that in one second .
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
or take li@@ p@@ stick .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
everybody was having some ca@@ ke earlier .
so not saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding .
let &apos;s take s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers for example , right ?
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
everything that &apos;s inside can be u@@ tili@@ zed .
it &apos;s all com@@ post@@ able all of it .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
so give me a hand here .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives .
and the list can go on forever .
so what are arch@@ a@@ ic models ?
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
it &apos;s the so-@@ called o@@ sit model .
in the beginning there was the tri@@ b@@ al society , charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by language .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global theme .
everybody is now trying to re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise something in this pattern .
now you see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
that &apos;s what the nor@@ m says .
let me give you good close look at this .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
life hadn &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
well it was a fri@@ day , this is true .
no one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
but so many over the years were helped .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my fourth techni@@ que : condition for complexity .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photographs .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
you move around , you have fun .
you can zo@@ om around very simply .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intui@@ tive .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
so now for the top@@ ic of today : financial sav@@ ings .
and let me show you a simple example .
the first on here is the classi@@ c , apple .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
and i have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
well i went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
that our input to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
we asked around and nobody knew .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 kids .
and those that were like that started to spli@@ t and divi@@ de .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since i was 16 .
story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sensor@@ ial .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
normally now , i would take the need@@ le out .
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
this is about one percent of the total population .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
we have been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
i was trying to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to re@@ store health from disease .
that is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
ladies and gentle@@ men , meet your cou@@ s@@ ins .
so two cou@@ ples each conc@@ ei@@ ving one baby .
so just imagine that for a moment .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
raise your hands . let me see .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
and let me begin with one example .
thank you so much for inv@@ enting behavi@@ oral economics .
it was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagination .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
what we want to do is make the future .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
maybe we can see it as change .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
just spread it as wide as possible .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
so that made sense , that was a match .
so again , that was a real good match .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
actually no , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that &apos;s a multi-@@ million dollar corpo@@ ration .
they need to tell me about my brand .
i no longer want to post@@ po@@ ne anything in life .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predic@@ table .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is key .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
it was four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
second half . end of normal time .
mon@@ day : color is powerful .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
that means something built in a city .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
and i thought i could bl@@ end in .
you can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
the three words are : do you remember ?
this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
let me show you how they work .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
and we keep setting our expec@@ tations higher and higher .
it was bus@@ y , i was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
it &apos;s all bo@@ und by oxygen and silic@@ ates .
we think about energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
i call it the ris@@ ing billion .
i want you to notice two things from this cur@@ ve .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hit@@ ter ?
i made it and i set to work tre@@ ating her .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
and we want to make this material acc@@ essi@@ ble to everyone .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
creates a bon@@ d , creates a bon@@ d of respect .
well , i think number one is curi@@ osity .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
and so that got me very excited .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
that really is very important , that we get there .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
so now they understand the value of prototyp@@ ing .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we have tw@@ ent@@ y percent in germany .
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
th@@ ank@@ fully many studies are being car@@ ried out on this top@@ ic .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons .
they rever@@ sed the flow of water .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
... these do@@ sages have something to do with it .
but you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
people in the satelli@@ te room are starting to move in now .
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
i can say , the ger@@ man chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
everyone take their vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ enting life .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly an it@@ em in the daily new@@ spa@@ pers .
now he &apos;s brought a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it plays .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
so to him , they were just blocks .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
yes , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quot@@ ation mar@@ ks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly mention a project .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
you are virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ing the reality without a computer .
and they didn &apos;t have phot@@ oli@@ th@@ ograph@@ y .
you probably saw it on the news .
and in this mind they had memory .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
and we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
let &apos;s make a short pro@@ visi@@ onal app@@ rais@@ al .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
the only thing they had was their mind .
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial .
to form a phr@@ ase with one &apos;s own breath .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
it &apos;s about making a bene@@ ficial po@@ op print .
i have a nice , con@@ cre@@ te example to illu@@ strate this .
and , being young , i said , expec@@ tation .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
beginn@@ ers &apos; clas@@ ses har@@ dly talk about interpretation .
these na@@ pp@@ ies are everywhere prac@@ tically .
there are also technical cy@@ cles .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
he &apos;s only dec@@ ei@@ ving you and not himself .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
in those countries where people have money .
but we know that if we were to say that out l@@ oud , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively dist@@ ur@@ bed .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
so we must get the phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
and how does it look in there ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , such as non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
and we can see that it can be done .
but phosp@@ hor@@ us will not be able to be re@@ placed .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
then i would say , my warm con@@ dol@@ ences , you see ?
of course not everything should be com@@ post@@ able .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
go@@ od@@ night swe@@ et o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot;
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
so it &apos;s got c@@ ute little game dynam@@ ics on it .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
save those . kill off the rest .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the op@@ tions of it .
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t .
and actually i become a character in the book .
so i think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t know the proto@@ col@@ s .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
i made the decision to move to the u.@@ s .
when i say re@@ alism , i mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alism .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
and i put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contro@@ ls in our car .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
we have the tools with this exponenti@@ al technology .
we have the passion of the di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ ve comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
and she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
that &apos;s the kind of sh@@ ame that is a teacher .
one i thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
given all of that , mistakes are inevi@@ table .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
in 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
and there is this stun@@ ning sil@@ ence .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and you can actually say things here that have im@@ pac@@ ts around the world .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integra@@ te the two .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;@@ am , i do . &quot;
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
here are the results we just ob@@ tain@@ ed .
so you can re@@ constru@@ ct a whole movement .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
tu@@ es@@ day : fit@@ ting in is way over@@ r@@ ated .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
both are vi@@ able ; both take off .
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle c@@ ry .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant anymore .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
would you like to be more attra@@ ctive and self-@@ confi@@ dent ?
how about living longer with good health ?
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
these results have been ob@@ tain@@ ed over several weeks of really hard labor .
but will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ gs set .
the dog ! i was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
and ultimately , we have to embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency .
em@@ c pres@@ ents : &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency . &quot;
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . forever . &quot;
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
it is nat@@ anz , and it is only nat@@ anz .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
all right , what is brand ger@@ ry ?
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ und@@ ant animals .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
we would never do that in our own countries .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here we have some natural fire@@ flies .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
in the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ v@@ ators .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
because they have special skills of facili@@ tation .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
and i understood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
so you could feel good about selling it .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
we went back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll into a decade .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and so , i really got bitten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean exploration .
thir@@ t@@ y-@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen .
secon@@ dly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
and we actually build stron@@ ger social relationships as a result .
there &apos;s an econom@@ ist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
i mean i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
and this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
we don &apos;t get that kind of const@@ ant feedback in real life .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
they divi@@ ded the entire king@@ dom in half .
so , i say : let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
ant@@ ony@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
the experi@@ en@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
i can cla@@ im anything .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out .
that &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can twi@@ st that around .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
i can cla@@ im anything .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and &quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
everyone knew your geni@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
go bo@@ ther leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fix@@ ed them .
it exp@@ ands in winter and contra@@ cts in summer .
but the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are aware of each other .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
i look forward to talking with all of you .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
every large image is the beginning of a section .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els .
so paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of having too many choices .
you know , nothing is possible in this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l . &quot;
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace .
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
now , this is an inter@@ active carto@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in tw@@ ent@@ y years .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
it &apos;s a type of terri@@ tor@@ ial behavior , right ?
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
in reality the notes are very va@@ gue and im@@ pre@@ cise .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
so ants wei@@ gh more than we do .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen when music is played .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
because artists have a di@@ stor@@ ted relationship to the lie .
that it comes to the human from outside .
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees .
you &apos;ll need some lo@@ gic here , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on the top@@ ic natural user interface design .
each society is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by one primary medium .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
so if you think of the google glas@@ ses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concep@@ ts that allows us to com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our aff@@ in@@ ity for virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ation , of experi@@ en@@ cing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being add@@ ressed again .
those are spaces that are able to re@@ act to a human intelli@@ g@@ ently .
we can take a look at that now .
i &apos;ll be reve@@ aling what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
and the third area spea@@ ks for itself really .
and then it &apos;s less us@@ able or user friend@@ ly .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glas@@ ses .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
how can i make something as user friend@@ ly as possible ?
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this ent@@ ry .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
the next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it .
and we built an i@@ pad app@@ lic@@ ation .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
and i see the same process with combin@@ ing photographs .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y .
so that &apos;s occu@@ py@@ thes@@ e@@ c movement has done .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstra@@ ct information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
but what about this day , this one particular fri@@ day ?
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of ja@@ m .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird programs .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
gr@@ ants and spon@@ sor@@ s were sou@@ ght .
it &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzz@@ le still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
but our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
here , let me give you an analog@@ y .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
now the fish is on the i@@ u@@ c@@ n red list .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ attle .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
so it says , &quot; place your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
and these women would get together and just talk .
30 years ago that would have so@@ unded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ entation that we have to change .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment .
well , we pres@@ ented this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ <<unk>> .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
fr@@ ance sc@@ or@@ es . it@@ al@@ y sc@@ or@@ es .
they were moving towards a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
we called it digital water pa@@ vili@@ on .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
how do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please b@@ low up . &quot;
so sex can come in lots of different var@@ ie@@ ties .
the first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
he rob@@ bed every o@@ un@@ ce of hope from my being .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
imagine then just two other little changes .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
if you have something to give , give it now .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
now , chimpanze@@ es are well-@@ known for their ag@@ gr@@ ession .
play is the gl@@ ue that bin@@ ds us together .
he says , &quot; bra@@ ce for impact . &quot;
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
are you min@@ d@@ ful , sophisti@@ cated like 00@@ 7 ?
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a c@@ age .
the next one : this was the best day ever .
what are some other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
and i think there &apos;s almost a parado@@ x with those .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
so we don &apos;t have the bud@@ gets that other br@@ ands have .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so , simple : you come to goog@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
you look around at all these muse@@ ums here .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless .
you zo@@ om in . you really go in .
i sell pet to@@ ys all over the country , all over the world .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous sc@@ ents .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
think about this : this attack is gener@@ ic .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bom@@ b .
so we start with a windows dro@@ pp@@ er .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
we are talking about -- around about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
it actually is much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
but what this image represents was the problem .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to face .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
how much money does it take to do this ?
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
so go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fla@@ vor , too .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
so , i was completely s@@ mitten by this , and had to do more .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
it &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the ei@@ gh@@ ties .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
and then we tried out a whole load of simu@@ lations .
and that is an es@@ cape from his tor@@ mented state .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , t@@ ar-@@ like fla@@ vor .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
the first example works with the pres@@ um@@ ption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ ops .
i know what people think when they see this .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i expla@@ ined it .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighb@@ ors . thanks .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of e@@ den .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra@@ ps .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
and the answer is really stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : they are lost forever .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ?
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
the disaster is for that two billion .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a , polio ...
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
it &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
you know , you can choose your list .
ask questions , demand pro@@ of , demand evidence .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s un@@ fair .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it caused im@@ men@@ se celebra@@ tion in the control room .
it is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , and other things that are sc@@ ary .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting cle@@ aner everyday .
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
bla@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
re@@ power america . it &apos;s time to get real .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
one con@@ sequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
however there is a political battle in our country .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s a funny oc@@ curr@@ ence , you know .
have you ever seen a climate neu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
that means the rate of crime goes down .
in h@@ oll@@ and we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
and oil will be able to be re@@ placed by other energy sources .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effec@@ tivity .
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-@@ na@@ pp@@ y stage , so to speak .
and as we get older , the na@@ pp@@ ies get bigger .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you are you really serious ?
he s@@ mil@@ ed and said , oh ?
he only lived until the age of thir@@ t@@ y-@@ nine .
the music instrument is an exten@@ sion of our own body .
it is not only a nice w@@ all@@ paper made of noise .
one a baby needs about si@@ x-@@ thousand na@@ pp@@ ies .
and also anything they would con@@ j@@ ure up in their minds today .
before this , we were in the so-@@ called age of feu@@ d@@ alism .
we no longer produce .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
there &apos;s already a rather impres@@ sive number of people worldwide .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t regi@@ ster@@ ed .
and today we are still very , very depen@@ dent on stories .
what happened is the the so-@@ called machine age .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but co@@ di@@ fy them through language .
just like it used to happen in the village .
and of course how design affec@@ ts perception .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is head@@ ing toward ?
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . living ? ye@@ p .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
we &apos;re seeing this process fe@@ eding back on itself .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
and they actually ill@@ umin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
it &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
it was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
my male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but combin@@ ed , they can create something like this .
secon@@ dly , photos combin@@ ed should have the same type of light .
it always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in janu@@ ary .
and i saw mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
they put her on a venti@@ l@@ ator .
and how it fol@@ ds dic@@ tat@@ es its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ ist .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who bat@@ s 300 .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times sa@@ f@@ ely out of every 10 .
and all the while , i was a@@ mas@@ sing more and more knowledge .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
she had ir@@ rever@@ si@@ ble brain damage .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
what will they consu@@ me ? what will they desire ?
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
yeah , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
and i had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
a kind of ast@@ on@@ ishing er@@ ror rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany . &quot;
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
a couple months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten all about it .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
well , their experi@@ en@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
but we know very little about where things go .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
if you are happy , you are going to attra@@ ct other happy people to you .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there is no exc@@ use for any of us here in this audience .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive wild@@ card .
only i think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
that &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying .
they have a distin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
it &apos;s a very rare occasi@@ on that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ berg roll@@ ing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ phan@@ ies .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
and i can tell you that this is a transforma@@ tive experience .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ?
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ motivation .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
and he &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so , he &apos;s rational .
a friend of mine did that -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stron@@ ger , with more stam@@ ina .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ co ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more satis@@ fied you are .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logi@@ cal side either .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
but what if you want to see br@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
the idea is to circum@@ vent a digital safety system .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i fil@@ med in war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , i &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
you see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days .
i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
this is a simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
well dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a c@@ .@@ a .
except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign c@@ .@@ a .
it was called the auto@@ matic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck .
a few years ago i started developing li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare black@@ -@@ shoul@@ dered ki@@ te .
and i talked them into fund@@ ing an expedi@@ tion .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concern@@ s about that .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the is@@ lan@@ ders .
because it doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack it should go to first .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved you .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
and in ber@@ lin there was this crazy engineering collective .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent at the moment .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you fe@@ eding ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s where he sig@@ ned up .
we think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit complexity .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ?
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
and she asked him , so what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
there &apos;s ste@@ p-@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
they spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sti@@ cks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fund@@ ed .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
that is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of ourselves .
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system su@@ cks .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tives .
a young la@@ d like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fir@@ es .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge er@@ ror .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs inside dete@@ c@@ tors .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
we think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ ells good , too .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if we over@@ sho@@ ot , we can po@@ ur a little bit back .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in have ?
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
and i think it makes the world look like this .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
we can di@@ ve in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
they live lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
but it turns out syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing dna is very difficult .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poetry .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
i play to explain what these t@@ ones might have meant .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not har@@ m@@ ful .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
there &apos;s the a direct re@@ turning system for this .
a all the beautiful things in life are in@@ efficient .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
i &apos;m aware of the brea@@ thing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimul@@ ating conversation .
a piece of music that is interpre@@ ted for the um@@ p@@ te@@ ent@@ h time is compar@@ able in this way .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
when you go running , right , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
it will lose half of its value in one year .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intui@@ tive it is .
i &apos;d like to rein@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to a particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the sus@@ pen@@ se .
but our perception , how it dec@@ ei@@ ves us too .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
and other another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
we can see that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
so the question is , how should we deal with na@@ pp@@ ies ?
here we have a the pro@@ of , by the way , that humans are not pig@@ s .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machin@@ ery of government .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technologi@@ cal definition of platform here .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
because all of these technologies are fe@@ eding back on themselves .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
this idea of fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that i do .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
cat@@ s were watching other cat@@ s watch this video .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participa@@ te .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
i knew she had come to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to help this patient ?
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
and that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
but the point is , we still come to gala@@ pa@@ gos .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted sa@@ f@@ ely , hit sa@@ f@@ ely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
i walked through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
and i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
this is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very ra@@ pid .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
because with marine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales in ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ on@@ g@@ ly con@@ vi@@ cted .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
it was the threat of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped their lives .
the cost of solar dro@@ pped 50 percent last year .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this jan@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and forth .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty jum@@ ped up and he ran over to this older black man .
well there are opportunities all around us .
so let &apos;s project this analog@@ y going forward .
car colors , ex@@ teri@@ or car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
the typical wal@@ m@@ art today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
so they go around and do art instal@@ lations like this .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
this is an a@@ ver@@ a@@ ge-@@ size green@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ e@@ berg .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ f@@ its bring with her ?
but there was always a life cycle to their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
this is called the e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
that &apos;s what kee@@ ps us going and kee@@ ps us developing .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ f@@ its right now .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
this is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
if it stopped twi@@ t@@ ching , you bur@@ y them .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanze@@ es , your living clo@@ s@@ est relative .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in .
so i wear two hat@@ s in most of what i do .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
we &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty a@@ wes@@ ome .
i say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and here i &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the mom@@ a , again in new york .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opini@@ on , even come from the muse@@ ums .
and what i realized is i needed an exper@@ t .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
now it &apos;s only at pre@@ cise times when they al@@ ig@@ n .
i mean , this is just my logi@@ cal side talking .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
i was given the gift of a mira@@ cle , of not dying that day .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style assem@@ bly language .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hu@@ d@@ son river .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
so the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
i don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
well let me work up some blood for you .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it su@@ cks .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the rene@@ w@@ able sources .
he said , &quot; we farm exten@@ si@@ vely , not intensi@@ vely .
i grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y diet of science fi@@ ction .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
so , the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated in the creation of many mira@@ cles .
we &apos;re using games to es@@ cape re@@ al-@@ world suffering .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
speci@@ alized skills and facili@@ tation skills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong success .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the w@@ inning team .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
i asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
well , that night , everybody went to celebra@@ te in the center .
we find other kinds of wei@@ r@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ pants and that &apos;s it .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensi@@ ble design .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists there isn &apos;t such a test .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be ad@@ ded to that ?
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
it is actually the true integra@@ tion of the man and the machine .
but nothing has been invented that en@@ ables me to walk , until now .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ able environment for those bacteria .
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
and our nation &apos;s really fo@@ unded on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , i need you to go into the house .
the secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ i@@ ties .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gent .
and this is a syndro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
so we have a lot of very roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ rene@@ wing .
and the great indi@@ c@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in .
that &apos;s our yo@@ un@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be in@@ t@@ act again .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
and instead of p@@ ani@@ cking , he just stopped .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
new invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
last year at ted i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of condu@@ ct .
then , in my opini@@ on , a really good code was created .
so that &apos;s just one app@@ lic@@ ation among many that you can use .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
and they are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , individuals .
should i respond to this email ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
this hit me when i went to replace my je@@ ans .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
it &apos;s an independent terri@@ tory . they control all miner@@ al resources .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t se@@ ttle .
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromo@@ some ?
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
so that was a very successful ha@@ ck in my opini@@ on .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
there was no key@@ board instrument such as the piano in b@@ ach &apos;s time .
an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you might know talks about this time .
the com@@ pos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes .
the l@@ oud and soft sym@@ b@@ ols , f and b , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
you no longer need to whi@@ st@@ le or sing a song .
then my question is , how profession@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fair@@ er than you .
that the human des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or .
so when kl@@ aus says , there is no sou@@ l .
there was the le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen nuclear research plant .
and i played the first movement of the bee@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to .
what were their life circum@@ stances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
so i looked into when things are natural and intui@@ tive .
and six@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
and they did this using so-@@ called lead maps .
that means they navi@@ g@@ ated through the use of sound and rhyth@@ m .
the con@@ sequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
so it &apos;s about effec@@ tivity , not efficiency .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absor@@ b and rele@@ ase phosp@@ hor@@ us .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
even if you were to sho@@ ot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limit@@ ations .
it would be so energi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on everyone &apos;s humanity .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
i was giving some lec@@ tures in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
socie@@ tal deca@@ y . 65 dead .
but somehow we can insu@@ late ourselves from this problem .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundament@@ ally changed our world .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
and this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing to me .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t result .
turned tr@@ as@@ h@@ can on its side . walked home .
that &apos;s where the dra@@ matic incre@@ ases have come in our prison population .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blocks had become the building block of our time .
somebody broke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some of my do@@ o@@ zi@@ es have been in the last five years .
i looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qu@@ ish@@ es human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
and that was the message that i absor@@ bed when i was in med school .
do you know what they call a 300 hit@@ ter in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
he invited over to dinner the king of si@@ am .
it is about taking that which was sc@@ ar@@ ce and making it ab@@ und@@ ant .
so find the programs that come clo@@ s@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- forever .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t-@@ rich environments .
if they could do it for them , sur@@ ely they could do it for me .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this od@@ d country road .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappe@@ ared .
when you look at the people you deal with ..
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
and when they are com@@ promis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
here you see a sam@@ ple of this actual attack code .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that purpose , has really changed my life .
i &apos;m dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
how does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
we ki@@ cked his bed so that he could see out .
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represent ?
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ plo@@ aded to youtube every minute .
and my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , ted .
this is my wi@@ f@@ i scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing trip .
so the first rule is that photos combin@@ ed should have the same perspective .
photos like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
three months later i had rel@@ oc@@ ated , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure has continu@@ ed .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
the greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
that &apos;s literally co@@ vering just like a two and a hal@@ f-@@ week period .
this air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilometers .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embra@@ ce fear .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of moment@@ um .
we &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it just si@@ ts there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal computer is a mira@@ cle .
it brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropriate .
i really do believe that , and , no , it a@@ in &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
we type , we fi@@ le , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
and if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlan@@ tic .
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
nasa has this phr@@ ase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
it &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
and from these , i can dri@@ ll into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
and we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and-@@ half year period .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link cau@@ sation and cor@@ relation .
that feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
before we had a@@ wes@@ ome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ au@@ rus back then .
and i tend to think of it like my sha@@ dow .
this is a portra@@ it by a photograph@@ er named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
there are 6@@ 8 million people esti@@ ma@@ ted to be in wheel@@ cha@@ irs worldwide .
mark , mark , come back .
in order to ada@@ pt success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
as the one hat , i do history of an@@ atom@@ y .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
now , we love to wra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
all cultures through all time have constantly been enga@@ ged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and then we have to de@@ cre@@ ase our mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties in the network .
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like to explain them brie@@ fly .
a cru@@ cial tool in information bro@@ ker@@ age has always been stories .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
you atta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
and this tra@@ des under the names open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core conc@@ ern of of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
which of course very much ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ es for story@@ telling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
and to see how we process information , how do we absor@@ b information ?
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you .
well , how do we boot up a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194@@ 6 .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
that &apos;s high-@@ tech agriculture of course , but the pl@@ ots take care of themselves .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
writing books is my prof@@ ession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me .
if your work bom@@ bed , not entirely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
this is a very direct way to get back nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
the second theor@@ em is th@@ us , if kl@@ aus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man .
and then they start pil@@ ing up st@@ ones so your view is blo@@ cked .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
according to which lo@@ gic do we dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , this will@@ ing@@ ness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is val@@ id in our un@@ conscious minds ?
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my pres@@ entation .
this rule of three con@@ tains three theor@@ em@@ s .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
a work of art that is never looked at will never ga@@ ther the strength to have an effect .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ement about what is val@@ id .
but with this lo@@ gic , which just uses the fact that two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect and atta@@ ches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
two equ@@ ally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ natur@@ es will can@@ c@@ el each other out .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappe@@ ars .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
you collect information about the piece in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
to main@@ tain the dialo@@ gue , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er .
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
interpre@@ ters are trans@@ lat@@ ors of the written notes in res@@ o@@ unding music .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
because the plant in frank@@ fur@@ t would be the best at w@@ inning back phosp@@ hor@@ us .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen ac@@ tively ?
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
you prac@@ tically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fing@@ ers .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether you like its taste or not .
whether the music is too pe@@ p@@ per@@ y or swe@@ et for your taste .
as we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
all along , all fan@@ t@@ asy books have always had maps , but these maps have been sta@@ tic .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
my story begins right here actually in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
the united states now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ ord here .
it brings together image and text and anima@@ tion and sound and touch .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
that &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
so you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
and those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
tsun@@ ami war@@ ning . cyber@@ -@@ attac@@ ks .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
today we can point at do@@ zens of companies that have done just that .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play .
because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
you had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
at the end you want to susta@@ in mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
and you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came up with this .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
and i think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that &apos;s me .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
there &apos;s nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology coming on , nan@@ o@@ materials .
by 20@@ 20 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
and this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at ? &quot;
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
we have two beings , both conc@@ ei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an et@@ ch a sk@@ et@@ ch .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving bell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot;
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor tony , temp@@ t , and his cause .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages .
and nei@@ ther your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
anybody who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to go a long way .
it &apos;s when it@@ al@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ up .
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transpor@@ tation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this da@@ y-@@ in and da@@ y-@@ out .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national g@@ aller@@ y .
hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
it &apos;s both 3d scan@@ ning in real time and motion capture .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics .
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question of content of character ?
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
the sm@@ ells from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park .
and we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at man@@ aging those choices ?
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
but just sub@@ stit@@ ute a@@ partment building for cities .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his ch@@ ie@@ f of staf@@ f .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of metal .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anima@@ te objects feel the same way .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
you could try and exp@@ and the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
all par@@ ties , all fac@@ tions in society , bac@@ ked this .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted@@ global .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
that &apos;s the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the-@@ job experience .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fra@@ mes .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expedi@@ tions .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward one .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milli@@ seconds .
so it atta@@ ches a third theor@@ em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theor@@ em@@ s and only acts as if the opposite of the first theor@@ em had already been pro@@ ven and given pri@@ ority .
century .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
that &apos;s equivalent to the out@@ put of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver@@ ted particularly quickly .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could re@@ build the <<unk>> .
that &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
we have thir@@ ty gi@@ ga@@ watt of phot@@ o-@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic power in germany .
there will be a whole load of resi@@ stance and argu@@ ments .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or , you might say , who believe that the sou@@ l brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the sou@@ l is an in@@ corpo@@ real frame@@ work around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of fl@@ es@@ h and blood , are soli@@ d , so to speak , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
we did a game called super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute for the future .
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the kni@@ fe trick .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
a cru@@ cial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
standing before him is a gor@@ ge@@ ous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus v@@ acc@@ ine with a bunch of other people .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
she wasn &apos;t going to vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against polio , no way .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ishing thing .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real .
nam@@ ely to lie in such a way that you can simply imple@@ ment this lo@@ gic in the wrong way .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
it does not have a tan@@ gi@@ ble , material nature .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ eline !
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have br@@ us@@ hed up against that thing , at times .
but when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ je@@ ction will kill you ?
and i promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ables up .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real <<unk>> scene <<unk>> , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting there and everything .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can &apos;t even guess at .
then i took a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser and connected it to that .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese invasi@@ on .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa ge@@ o@@ spa@@ tial image .
but the spa@@ tial arr@@ ange@@ ment of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in sou@@ th-@@ e@@ ast@@ -@@ asia .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
the const@@ ant f@@ loo@@ ding of music today is not very bene@@ ficial there .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bor@@ ed .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this frame@@ work .
all this influ@@ ences me and influ@@ ences my experience of the com@@ position .
he asked me what the pre@@ am@@ ble to this bal@@ la@@ d was in my opini@@ on .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classi@@ cal music .
so that what they had only con@@ ju@@ red up in their minds becomes listen@@ able .
i say , ul@@ f , why do you need such a big car ?
you can also try it with words like re@@ ven@@ ge or ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and the like .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that he has something entirely different in mind .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c , a a bunch of ama@@ te@@ urs .
he &apos;s interested in setting fir@@ es .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
and that &apos;s the proje@@ ction of seeing , feedback , seeing .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
from the age of feu@@ d@@ alism to the to the machine age .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still pri@@ mar@@ ily at .
and these two worl@@ ds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clas@@ hing with each other at the moment .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
some of them are also regi@@ ster@@ ed together with the ha@@ cker@@ spaces , those places .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutri@@ ents .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
the ground stor@@ es over six@@ ty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
tradition@@ ally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
you can only be climate neu@@ tra@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
of those have you ever heard of over@@ population of trees ?
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intelle@@ ct as we are .
but thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in ja@@ ils and pris@@ ons .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started argu@@ ing .
drug war . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
her parents were born in sla@@ very in virg@@ ini@@ a in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and laun@@ ch k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the i@@ pad .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tion@@ ing as a single organis@@ m .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magni@@ tude in performance scale .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my fi@@ le .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
so one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but government played a key role here .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
he had a poten@@ tially life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condition called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensor@@ s .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
among those pa@@ pers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
in this country , as many as 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of pre@@ vent@@ able medical er@@ r@@ ors .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
under@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , exponenti@@ ally growing technologies .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
why didn &apos;t i ask my atten@@ ding ? why did i send her home ?
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dru@@ cker .
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
it &apos;s not about being sc@@ ar@@ ce , it &apos;s about acc@@ essi@@ bility .
but the king of si@@ am , he was f@@ ed with al@@ umin@@ um u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship .
evolution does not necessarily fa@@ vor the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
imagine a big explosion as you clim@@ b through 3,000 ft .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stron@@ ger .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s arch@@ a@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the 8@@ 0s .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the exp@@ o .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it .
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromo@@ som@@ es .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great ap@@ es .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
every single harvard employe@@ e is now auto@@ matically en@@ roll@@ ed in a life@@ cycle fund .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written that would have contain@@ ed this in it ?
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also fri@@ days .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain bear .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , communities of participa@@ tion and un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there .
he types &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this offi@@ cial knowledge base .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-@@ cent tour .
so if you think about this prac@@ tically , here &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
how would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing over .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embra@@ ce risk .
it &apos;s a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear : mod@@ ular , liquid .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
and the set was based as an ex@@ act repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
no f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical do@@ ma@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
that number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rapi@@ dly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introdu@@ ce to you .
on this island , that &apos;s the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on a@@ z@@ or@@ es .
in it , there are always three dies@@ els running , two are always main@@ tain@@ ed .
the brown bit is the conven@@ tional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic out@@ put of two hundred kil@@ o@@ watt + to the network .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
so i want to extra@@ po@@ late on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
it came to the table a bright , almost shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
it &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
they raised bee@@ f c@@ attle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always ye@@ ar@@ ned for more creativity .
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
we want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ ver@@ sity as something more than just tough times .
ad@@ ver@@ sity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
these are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ gles of con@@ go .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody sus@@ pe@@ cted anything .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
if you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
in terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c win .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
i worked in the collective for el@@ even years , it was based on a gras@@ s@@ roots democracy .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
i took the liber@@ ty i asked li@@ l@@ ly , if it would be okay to mention her .
the united states is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with china .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
not the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
this is the kan@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
in the and@@ es , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of drin@@ king water for this city .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
i think it &apos;s better if we encoura@@ ge our great creative minds to live .
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
so let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean coal facili@@ ty .
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression .
so it was curi@@ osity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
you &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and what what are our values and what are what are our obje@@ c@@ tives , our fundamental principles ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
well , so it says pre@@ st@@ o at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
that makes the baby carb@@ on-@@ positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
the so , music fun@@ ctions a lot like spo@@ ken language in my opini@@ on .
you study works that have been com@@ posed before or after .
you introdu@@ ce a new idea and this is ans@@ wer@@ ed inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
because they changed their cha@@ ir@@ man of the board of direc@@ tors twice now .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environ@@ ment@@ ally aware .
i &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very element@@ ary .
we use our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
the mel@@ o@@ dy is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhyth@@ m is created through dance .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bis@@ ho@@ p of wor@@ ce@@ ster .
she li@@ kes him a lot , because he has the tenden@@ cy to be for@@ th@@ right .
they &apos;re on the ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h ti@@ ps , but also el@@ se@@ where in the landscape , right ?
you see it straight away .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
so , as a designer , i design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appe@@ ar@@ ance .
you can explain this much more el@@ abor@@ ately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
that was then re@@ placed by the classi@@ cal age and the first type of abstra@@ ction .
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
the law of pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity , the law of of continu@@ ity , etc .
and for them language had in@@ fer@@ ior importance .
that means you can see how to win back nutri@@ ents on the internet .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consi@@ der@@ ably more intui@@ tive and natural .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
there are still six hundred billion trees in the ama@@ zon forest alone .
so all of our intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be du@@ mber than trees .
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better .
and those were the most primi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- i &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
but if i could give it and still see them sa@@ f@@ ely through , i would .
it &apos;s not really what is reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks reali@@ stic really .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ tain@@ ed right now .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city hall .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in febru@@ ary last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
all the rest of that day , that after@@ noon , i had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my sto@@ mach .
a big fis@@ her@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
thre@@ ats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .
here &apos;s v@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es with each one specific function .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
these people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars inje@@ cted into the global economy .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about ex@@ ecu@@ ting people . &quot;
we need to find ways to embra@@ ce these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some be@@ er . &quot;
and these were the things she thought we needed to com@@ mit to .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill .
i had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . &quot;
and we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
and i &apos;ve been repres@@ enting these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sent@@ ences .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ i@@ cide cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it runs through the women .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
i looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
so we do need target theor@@ ies that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved her@@ s .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1@@ d .
and more than anything , are you being the best par@@ ent you can ?
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i am brea@@ thing in its ancient atmosphere .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover .
and as a matter of fact , this fa@@ ke input data is actually pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
and someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ atom@@ y .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there .
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
you see the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber .
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ noon , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary .
this is a highly us@@ eless categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked ja@@ m for our experiment .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave la@@ tin america to go to the united states .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
and similar to &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
so &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed anima@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pus@@ hing them more towards failure .
i think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er co@@ aster are you on ?
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their streng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
went in , and i started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything .
here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ tles , we have geor@@ die making ...
you take them away , disease comes back , horri@@ ble diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
we talk about it in ir@@ onic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 50@@ 0,000 kids in the developing world every year .
a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mira@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
we bar@@ ely break even . there is no f@@ ame in it .
and no important en@@ dea@@ vor that requi@@ red innovation was done without risk .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost profi@@ le .
his sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essen@@ ce of the i@@ ter@@ ative process .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
i could see in her eyes , it was ter@@ ror . life was over .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ u@@ tions being cap@@ tured .
but the cool@@ est i ever worked on was around this guy .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all i put in my su@@ it@@ case .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks are not in the middle east .
thank you for sc@@ aring the living da@@ y@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ ph .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
so let me now introdu@@ ce to you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ rier .
the act of kin@@ dness she not@@ ed above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
we bran@@ ch off of a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
evolution favor@@ s those creatures best adap@@ ted to their environment .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choo@@ sing to have more males than fe@@ males .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i just came back from a community that hol@@ ds the secret to human survival .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of this aspe@@ ct in our narra@@ tives of human evolution .
not surpris@@ ingly , this destruction also en@@ dan@@ gers bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ stes are pump@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pl@@ asia .
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic . &quot;
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
last month scientists repor@@ ted the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscop@@ e .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination .
those wir@@ es carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
you want butt@@ on fly or zi@@ pp@@ er fly ? you want st@@ one@@ was@@ hed or aci@@ d-@@ was@@ hed ?
fro@@ sty the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy sou@@ l .
spa@@ tial reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , okay , to ha@@ ck into biology , you need material .
so the it &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically do@@ able .
that is i think they are less people have regi@@ ster@@ ed than actually exist .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
that &apos;s the medium of print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen lam@@ a .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
there are indi@@ c@@ ator fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
think of this as the long tail to ste@@ phen law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it produ@@ ces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
using a kind of tor@@ ch , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t say that , because that would be a little poli@@ tically in@@ cor@@ rect .
people always ask me , what are you resear@@ ching in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of all the time ?
we negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i looked for new sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders .
mu@@ st-@@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequ@@ ency .
and you really have to stay pretty fir@@ m while doing so , but i think it &apos;s it &apos;s possible .
so you sense it already .
now we have the third theor@@ em .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ od@@ y-@@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a whit@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
it ta@@ sted swe@@ et and clean , like you were taking a bi@@ te of the ocean .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality ch@@ art organized by age .
bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass is an ass that is made pur@@ ely of nature .
so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fi@@ ction part of it .
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
a woman in germany s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws about six point three kil@@ os of li@@ p@@ stick in her lifetime .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be cli@@ ma@@ te@@ -@@ positive .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director .
the next generation of graphic user inter@@ faces already works with behavi@@ our a lot more .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the lo@@ gic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
so , you don &apos;t ab@@ sta@@ in from food just because you can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you don &apos;t need to ab@@ sta@@ in from listening to classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
this is harder to check or bring down .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ples center ...
rec@@ ession . de@@ fau@@ lt . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this h@@ oll@@ er .
and rather than having economic shu@@ t@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic inje@@ ction ever .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 8@@ 8 minutes .
at the time i was as@@ sig@@ ned to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
and part of the narra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to re@@ lie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
we have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ o@@ le .
over time , we concent@@ rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
and you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fix@@ ed on the bottom .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe@@ g@@ ged it at 100,000 .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him on his way .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make it happen .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
we went to san pau@@ l@@ o where they have ban@@ ned out@@ door adverti@@ sing .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is sing@@ apo@@ re .
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching const@@ it@@ u@@ tional crisis .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small bottle of po@@ ison .
are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , reser@@ ved , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
what is the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ pa stage are you in now ?
failed wri@@ ter-@@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic brand .
or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i deliver the goods .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put up online .
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pad , take the fire@@ flies out .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last for six years .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
and nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distin@@ ct ...
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
made all these films , made all these docum@@ ent@@ ary films for a very limited audience .
and that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
this en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
usually , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mira@@ cle by a certain date .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
when countries get together in places like cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ uss the co2 .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fi@@ cs , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the par@@ king lot outside of his hospital .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever cho@@ se farmer .
she saved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teachers &apos; lo@@ un@@ ge .
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
i have had the distin@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automo@@ bile factory .
my opini@@ on is that the mo@@ s@@ sad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
and so when i started travel@@ ing and going to these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ cate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , intri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possibility .
so here , we have a young female and a male enga@@ ged in a ch@@ ase game .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conc@@ ei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
early after@@ noon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavi@@ oral change .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensor@@ s stopped working .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it requi@@ red enormous planning .
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
he &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christ@@ mas was this one .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psych@@ ed out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
i &apos;d like to explain that a little more .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely .
we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating it increasingly quick@@ er and better , for example .
he &apos;s ab@@ und@@ ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
that made the whole thing consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
we &apos;ve tried various approach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to mini@@ mal components .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intui@@ tive ?
and they were always magni@@ fi@@ cent , because the dan@@ cers were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
it takes co2 to me@@ than@@ e using molecular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the dies@@ el system , if the price of dies@@ el ris@@ es by five percent a year .
you sense that that <<unk>> s the actual truth behind the sentence .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ tors , which would be prop@@ he@@ t .
they were all called k@@ f@@ as at the time , the place in j@@ ü@@ lich was also called a k@@ f@@ a .
the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ entation was , how to reach one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
the woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it didn &apos;t look anything like her .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the penguins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;ll ever be .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu@@ p@@ ils .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
what we musi@@ cians do with our musical language is very alien to non-@@ profession@@ als .
well , at se@@ vent@@ e@@ en you still have dreams , but no significant memor@@ ies .
and we think we &apos;re prote@@ cting the environment when we do a little less damage .
that means our entire intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
it consi@@ sts of tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six member countries that control for@@ ty percent of all the oil de@@ pos@@ its .
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
we &apos;d only be able to flo@@ at in the earth &apos;s se@@ as as am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once pain@@ ted a portra@@ it of a woman .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
but even if you imple@@ ment these indi@@ cations , it still just rema@@ ins something technical .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ it@@ able .
did you get a second or third opini@@ on , as people call it so ni@@ c@@ ely no@@ wa@@ days ?
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
in another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
the conclu@@ sion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by machin@@ ery .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
i had the great privi@@ lege , when i was a young law@@ yer , of meeting ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analog@@ ous to sex . &quot;
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way each time .
twice in one emergen@@ cy shift , i mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and orange is wire .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
the second story , also to illu@@ strate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wa@@ i@@ st@@ line .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and if we have ab@@ und@@ ant energy , we also have ab@@ und@@ ant water .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communic@@ ating .
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , nei@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
re@@ bec@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
well to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near the ent@@ r@@ ance of the store .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
and it got to the essen@@ ce , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ?
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
they can express their opini@@ on on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , ju@@ stin bie@@ ber , got his start on youtube .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
and so , recently , scientists have suggest@@ ed that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
in the united states , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worl@@ ds .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
this super@@ computer was called the global extin@@ ction awareness system , of course .
working with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are invi@@ ting them to learn social innovation skills .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really color@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ vering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
in fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on about progress .
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
climate skep@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the states .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stron@@ ger than the white p@@ ill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er-@@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dry day .
i guess what kind of gen@@ re , style i am would be like dark glam@@ or .
and then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words i &apos;ve ever heard .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
and so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ?
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
so tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
serve food at a sou@@ p kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i do not mean foot@@ ball .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
in a spli@@ t second , i lost all sen@@ sation and movement below my p@@ el@@ v@@ is .
i need you to go up@@ sta@@ irs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tou@@ g@@ her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is enter@@ ing our everyday objects .
it might be the evolutionary orig@@ in of the phr@@ ase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the ball@@ s . &quot;
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fis@@ m -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
fe@@ males , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
in california there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the si@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ pack .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
and she felt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her feet .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
o@@ .@@ k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant sets of vac@@ cin@@ es .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dra@@ matic increase in fir@@ es .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
and si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul@@ tane@@ ously the media produ@@ cer and medium .
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon just last apri@@ l .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
what &apos;s left is story@@ telling .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
with so many op@@ tions to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ x@@ ed fit ?
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no exc@@ use for failure .
and i would like to invi@@ te everyone to work on it and event try something y@@ ourselves .
if i asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries in all of europe . &quot;
by the way , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts electrical out@@ put on dies@@ el fuel basis is ad@@ ded in the world per year .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
and when you have one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then it &apos;s like a self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient system .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
and the reality of that expression reach@@ es all of us and moves us , in@@ spir@@ es and un@@ ites us .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
and because i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limit@@ s of possibility .
but when i cho@@ se a career as an adult , it was film@@ making .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
we took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
you were you were invited to dinner , not to ste@@ al nutri@@ ents .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the com@@ pos@@ er at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
but gradu@@ ally the written form became the primary medium , and ga@@ ined a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
that means the first impres@@ sion comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we percei@@ ve things .
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intui@@ tive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
that means we &apos;re losing five-@@ thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
but the concep@@ ts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities .
a lie like that shows you that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
all one &apos;s own music is destro@@ yed because you &apos;re constantly being bom@@ bar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself .
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
which i would very much re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a lo@@ vely , communic@@ ative thing .
of bee@@ tho@@ ven we know that he listen@@ ed more once he &apos;d already gone dea@@ f .
that &apos;s why com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ end on us interpre@@ ters to rein@@ vent the pieces again and again .
so in dec@@ ember we met in mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ nis@@ h addi@@ tional information about her .
the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that must be respe@@ cted by law .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ ni@@ ty .
now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning dete@@ ctor , our dan@@ ger dete@@ ctor .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it ble@@ e@@ ds it leads , &quot; is very true .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time ever in human history .
i mean , how many of you saw the w@@ inning of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by ib@@ m &apos;s wat@@ son ?
you see , sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resour@@ ce-@@ liber@@ ating force .
so this is a story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
the politics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res@@ ig@@ ned themselves to what was happening .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much sha@@ ped the way she saw the world .
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
and i got a big sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe did lots of development projects .
we ad@@ just our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le sent@@ ences for children .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ?
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ on@@ gst this tech@@ ie , ge@@ e@@ ky internet culture .
two pa@@ irs of stock@@ ings for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , i think it comes down to planning .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic .
i would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
and they found that the average ce@@ o enga@@ ged in about 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in a week .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p , called citizens connect .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
here i have a very complicated , mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
i think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ ster@@ ing toler@@ ance .
but at the time multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms come online , things start to change .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choo@@ sing .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chap@@ ter of mo@@ bility .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
they help in the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and cla@@ w .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ini@@ zing hor@@ m@@ one .
now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categ@@ ories would make somebody like me really happy .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality .
or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up and pl@@ us-@@ one strength , and pl@@ us-@@ one intelligence .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
and if you want the ulti@@ mate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the need@@ le .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ grown fl@@ es@@ h .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electr@@ on@@ ics .
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
these are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat that ro@@ tten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ va for instance .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
the brand that i am is , i would call it cas@@ ual fly .
are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
and so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechan@@ ical quant@@ um super@@ position .
how do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fres@@ hn@@ ess , more fres@@ hn@@ ess , three times fres@@ her .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ oral fusion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gress .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
if dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wid@@ ely read children &apos;s auth@@ or , in fact .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ li@@ sh it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ or@@ ing activity happening on the network .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the-@@ record conversation . &quot;
and after , as i refle@@ cted on that , i decided to elimin@@ ate negative energy from my life .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not sc@@ ary .
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
we need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an is .
because with pig@@ s , phosp@@ hor@@ us is rele@@ ased in their soli@@ d components fa@@ e@@ ces .
so by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- wo@@ of !
in@@ trin@@ si@@ c to these arch@@ a@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with virtu@@ ality .
but how is it with with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become something alien to us
we had the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , we have had the machine age and we are now ste@@ pping into the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
in in china a a cham@@ ber po@@ t is still called a hon@@ ey po@@ t , you could say , right ?
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
you see , there are two countries that control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ vo@@ irs worldwide .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large foot@@ print , which will turn into we@@ t@@ land .
a tv or a was@@ hing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t exp@@ end them .
if they get surro@@ unded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ relevant .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
something as dra@@ matic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self-@@ de@@ ception , up@@ right .
already in some s@@ hal@@ low la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ than@@ e is ac@@ tively bub@@ bling up out of the water .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
and this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
and i would please like the record to refle@@ ct today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
another example from a very different field . mon@@ et pain@@ ted his water@@ li@@ lies an infin@@ ite number of times .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
if you put you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
but what i wo@@ und up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ matically less than a power plant .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build c@@ ameras and lights and all kinds of things .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this glo@@ be .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 50@@ 0-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without ar@@ med gu@@ ards .
so , for better or for worse , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
that means it takes fif@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one po@@ und of farm tun@@ a .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the pa@@ pers is what you find in this third theor@@ em .
so through this mode of pas@@ sing on the bur@@ den of pro@@ ving something you are experi@@ en@@ cing the brilli@@ ance of the lie .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physi@@ cally , the european one .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ mil@@ l electro@@ chemical battery .
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut fore@@ sts .
we can &apos;t just do that .
or better : how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
the day before the event , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about fe@@ eding chicken to fish ? &quot;
instead of pus@@ hing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the admini@@ stration of crimin@@ al justice .
there &apos;s been this huge dec@@ line in crime in america over the last three decades .
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
vi@@ cious car@@ tel@@ s . announ@@ cer five : cau@@ stic cru@@ ise lines .
and also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a lo@@ g cur@@ ve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are conne@@ cting to the global conversation .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
when i was a child , i had multiple colle@@ ctions of sti@@ cks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and sh@@ ells .
in both cases , these are gro@@ ss under@@ esti@@ mates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ und@@ ant , before it gets extin@@ ct , it becomes rare .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
the second major group of attac@@ kers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pris@@ ons , on death row .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented .
and it creates this kind of social network around a colle@@ ction of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x-@@ in@@ ch layer on top .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
for her , life had dist@@ ill@@ ed itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in australia .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations sha@@ ping a new life together .
at the end of each day , i made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from myster@@ y science theater was one of the first people to post a jo@@ ke about the video on twitter .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
now i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and for example , the most sophisti@@ cated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstra@@ cting out .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our c@@ ameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
that also const@@ it@@ utes the entertain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
now when i was a fres@@ h@@ man in college , i took my first biology class .
but if you immer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the ex@@ ception of my physical therapy s@@ essi@@ ons .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re te@@ sted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
the human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaning@@ ful work .
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands .
evolution is all about pas@@ sing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
why not have the quick twi@@ tch muscle that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then aug@@ ments my strength and en@@ dur@@ ance .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
that means we all share a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ cker@@ y . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
people wra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ a@@ tics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ a@@ tics at all .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get pro@@ of , you need to accept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
so we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite distin@@ ct .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introdu@@ ction , i must say .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay choo@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it quali@@ fi@@ cations .
so , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since laun@@ ch .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; the harv@@ est@@ ers &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ gel at the met .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ zens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they followed ce@@ os around for a whole week .
so doing things like this -- you know , re@@ mind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
yet i am afraid of privi@@ lege , of e@@ ase , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our imagination .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
it is almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you are surro@@ unding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and this is why .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; trial and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to explore the answer , by building si@@ ft@@ ables .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
which is great , because the roman@@ s did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly clever individual .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myster@@ y .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe rec@@ order .
but every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ scen@@ dent .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next century .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
i can speed up the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del@@ ved into it more .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
i brought along an example of the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real living space .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of creativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friend@@ ly , so that anybody can use it ?
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ f@@ i works .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the arc@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limit@@ s on screen real e@@ state .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
this is called a law of design or gest@@ alt psychology , which in turn affec@@ ts our perception .
the vi@@ ral particles then were rele@@ ased from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rect all the er@@ r@@ ors .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with bes@@ i@@ des your existence as a designer .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ar@@ ise .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predic@@ tors , you can &apos;t prove that .
they will say , a person who has no sou@@ l is dead and can &apos;t cla@@ im anything .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a travel@@ ing wave re@@ actor .
that &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
there &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
we can see it again here we can see the dies@@ el again here , and all the individual ag@@ gre@@ gates here .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifest@@ yle .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cre@@ am wra@@ pping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
and half of the wa@@ ste@@ water problem worldwide is caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
that might sound m@@ und@@ an@@ e at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
making it differently or pre@@ t@@ tier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
over@@ view : i &apos;m inter@@ acting with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om back out , zo@@ om in .
in offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , tw@@ ent@@ y percent of the amount of waste produced by hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds consi@@ sts of na@@ pp@@ ies .
unfortunately not the one on offen@@ b@@ ach , but perhaps you can give the frank@@ fur@@ ters a hand .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hop@@ eless can@@ di@@ date .
i would like to explain this mechan@@ ism to you today and make it a little more acc@@ essi@@ ble to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an un@@ conscious level .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness here .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the des@@ cent of man .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . police pe@@ pp@@ er spra@@ y .
so given a do@@ zen news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
and this refer@@ end@@ um would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement and safety .
and police off@@ ic@@ ers were coming in and assi@@ stant pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and c@@ ler@@ k workers .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gold@@ man would study for a blood test .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half of their size .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
we made an app@@ lic@@ ation for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people ele@@ cted to office .
and i finally decided , oh go@@ sh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
well i ad@@ or@@ ed my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
we have life im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this country .
because it &apos;s in that ne@@ x@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ oles@@ ome . &quot;
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
but dan@@ ny , the whole american en@@ dea@@ vor is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
ad@@ ver@@ sity isn &apos;t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to ada@@ pt .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ ver@@ sity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
when a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
but not only that -- it will integra@@ te and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graph@@ y of the glo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vac@@ cin@@ es for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rect answer .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off .
it is about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about her life .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
so the capacity to play in prototyp@@ e is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams per@@ form .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one f@@ at@@ al fla@@ w , and that fla@@ w was this .
while any@@ time i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular jo@@ es .
well , since the film pre@@ mi@@ ered at the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , let &apos;s take a look .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the ted@@ talk .
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the w@@ inning team and the prime minister at the time .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
through my work i &apos;m trying to artic@@ u@@ late that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
because it &apos;s a tra@@ v@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
and you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dro@@ pped some@@ place .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docum@@ ent@@ aries .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
if you have 10 teams that typically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ stra@@ cted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
and it de@@ als with proble@@ m-@@ solving in a play@@ ful , creative , original way .
so as a citi@@ zen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
the next slide i show you will be a ra@@ pid fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
if you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it reach@@ es the sea .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
there are contro@@ versi@@ al top@@ ics such as all those gene@@ tically modi@@ fied plants in the fields .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
and that &apos;s why it is so stron@@ g@@ ly ro@@ ot@@ ed in us , this ability to deal with virtu@@ ality .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had phot@@ oli@@ th@@ ograph@@ y .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fi@@ ction , i know .
perhaps you could just brie@@ fly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explan@@ ation of what we &apos;re about to see .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
going back to my actual top@@ ic natural user interface and the top@@ ic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course .
we designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
that i can suddenly that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is becoming increasingly ir@@ relevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an app@@ lic@@ ation .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
when profess@@ ors become curious , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ me@@ ster .
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tra@@ pped in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
so this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not contain@@ ed within any one wikipedia page .
and yes , the discussion always revol@@ ves around how much of the future you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
you have to be able to c@@ ater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
and so , we started planning these and we wo@@ und up going to the bis@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehi@@ cles .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall .
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
sure , i will have thro@@ wn some colors away too , but i will have ad@@ ded new ones to take their place .
every year we lose about three ton@@ nes of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which should really be cir@@ cul@@ ated .
in h@@ oll@@ and it &apos;s easier to understand this , because h@@ oll@@ and built the country on flo@@ wers .
because the soil will the mo@@ ss dies and the the wind and water was@@ h away the soil .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contribu@@ ting to bio@@ diversity .
there &apos;s also an extra associ@@ ation , the cra@@ d@@ le-@@ to-@@ cra@@ d@@ le-@@ institute , where everybody can get involved .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
here you have to keep another philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a philosop@@ hi@@ cal slo@@ w-@@ bur@@ ner , close to hand .
when i turn up in my little v@@ w cl@@ un@@ ker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re dec@@ ei@@ ving yourself .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
we know that something else is really true .
i &apos;m talking about the sou@@ l .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and imagine if you would a@@ .@@ i@@ . &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
so what could three billion ris@@ ing , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
right now in al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
in r@@ wand@@ a , even after the geno@@ cide , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
so neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ und@@ ance that no one could have ever predi@@ cted .
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion machin@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding proteins than the best computers .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of k@@ ie@@ v in u@@ kra@@ ine .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vi@@ ral and then why that even matters .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pel the video to be as popular as it would become .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expres@@ sed more .
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
and every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the chemicals within them .
to these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
its flexi@@ ble design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high-@@ agi@@ li@@ ty mov@@ ements .
we are ready with our industry partner to introdu@@ ce this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; and see .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
the mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stor@@ es .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
this is an example of how adults in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
i first went to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to de@@ plo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
we do need the market in@@ centi@@ ves -- co2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
and any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
we want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot;
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worl@@ ds and not the real world .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not se@@ ttle into a career in law .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the dem@@ ands that i made on myself .
she remin@@ ded me that i was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ sto@@ m make your car .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her cas@@ ket .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
but when combin@@ ing photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
they are fru@@ strated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
because ta@@ ste@@ makers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel introdu@@ ce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
so , here we were making docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
but usually i have an ac@@ cess@@ ory , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or i like cr@@ y@@ st@@ al and things like that too .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
it also needs -- it needs dig@@ ni@@ ty , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ es . &quot;
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter -- fir@@ st-@@ gra@@ der , not much arti@@ stic talent ...
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the nat@@ anz ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facili@@ ty .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ c@@ tively better .
are you establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pa@@ thetic like the op@@ ra@@ h ?
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ards , there &apos;s no po@@ sters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , then we can p@@ lot our brain .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them .
i decided that rele@@ asing fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , bio@@ ha@@ cking de@@ als with modern molecular biology .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opport@@ une moment when i can take care of you .
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives pro@@ posed .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o@@ .@@ k. ?
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bio@@ - d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g , di@@ y bi@@ o .
vis@@ it@@ ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel@@ met .
and with that you can acceler@@ ate the particles stron@@ g@@ ly enough and then they enter the oni@@ ons .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the la@@ p of our parents .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the austr@@ ali@@ an ab@@ origin@@ als .
it just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able expec@@ tations about performance .
because you project an assu@@ mption that you &apos;re seeing something you re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise to the front , such as a circle .
and those other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attra@@ ctive .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental nor we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related spa@@ tially in this way .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
i &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ matic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ re@@ ment plans .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an in this , you know it .
spec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of at@@ las under construction so you can see the scale .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
i was just asked whether this s@@ ack is a talking s@@ ack and will talk for me .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
this is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change oc@@ curr@@ ing in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ formed into understanding , a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and gra@@ ce .
even better , it was far@@ m-@@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish i had the night before .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been jo@@ ining my side in the last couple of years .
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s non@@ sense , a play@@ thing for kids , we calcul@@ ated everything , it will never add up .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appe@@ ared in this issue , the spor@@ ts .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fi@@ ction movie .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
and he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ oning him in his sleep .
i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means the water will re@@ main in the field for longer .
so no more saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding , re@@ duc@@ ing , no more gu@@ il@@ t management , but intelligent waste .
in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand ton@@ nes of ur@@ ani@@ um was put onto our fields in germany .
that &apos;s why all western emp@@ ires just kept on exp@@ and@@ ing until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they im@@ plo@@ ded .
it would be easy to just throw a li@@ tr@@ e of waste oil onto it and the p@@ lot would be ru@@ ined for years .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and that scienti@@ fically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly cor@@ rect , because because we don &apos;t know how much is k@@ is@@ sed away .
can i hand@@ le it directly or do i need a man@@ ual or a cor@@ respon@@ dent training .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es can take over the entire network .
now you probably think that the com@@ pos@@ er , when writing down the notes , already inclu@@ des everything they &apos;ve thought of .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already reti@@ red before i finally started studying .
our organis@@ m has come up with an exc@@ ell@@ ent method to make un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy simply disappe@@ ar .
that humans are supposed to have des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and that , yes , there is at least one ance@@ st@@ or shared by both humans and ap@@ es .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ te@@ ent@@ h
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
well that ori@@ entation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be enga@@ ged in .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
and because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
you see , even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure metal .
all of na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were f@@ ed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper i could .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
if i had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and rele@@ ased it in the room .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
in a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ planes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , that is being sha@@ ped by these out@@ comes .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contain@@ ed within a single mar@@ ble .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get sel@@ ec@@ ted out .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announ@@ ced , the next building block .
and if you look , for example , in the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
and i want you to see , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is quie@@ tly playing with water .
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vi@@ tal organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
understanding that these categ@@ ories are really much more un@@ stable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
i know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
or , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
i mean think of it , when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some di@@ visi@@ ons , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to say five-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical di@@ visi@@ ons that make sense to me and that i think we should re@@ tain .
henry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
not long after@@ wards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gressi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the poor@@ er they get .
d@@ k : you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
the stories of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
but now , because the refle@@ ctive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
i think the greatest ad@@ ver@@ sity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving environment .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
that was the first re@@ al-@@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
and the pre@@ mis@@ e was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
there was a gather@@ ing of resol@@ ve and a quie@@ t voice saying , &quot; i will b@@ yp@@ ass you . &quot;
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was cho@@ sen as the young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with c@@ ameras ready usually .
it turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
so half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car assem@@ bly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive .
so i think , in conclu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies out of them .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
so we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automo@@ bil@@ es or twitter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a regular con@@ figu@@ ration in two dimensions .
as the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rele@@ asing miner@@ al-@@ rich fresh water that n@@ our@@ ish@@ es many forms of life .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bus@@ he@@ hr nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ anz fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very clo@@ sely at data and data structures .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ulti@@ mate respect for an audience .
and you can see here too , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from the min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers , and je@@ t@@ blue .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive species .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and the interesting thing about that is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of regi@@ ons could be de@@ pic@@ ted through songs .
i brought this project along as an example to illu@@ strate how these arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models are being add@@ ressed again .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
and you inje@@ ct it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ ft@@ able against a sequence si@@ ft@@ able .
and then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that apply to the entire sequence .
and that &apos;s not within the range of ama@@ te@@ urs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
he would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from below and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
so i just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an to the front .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accor@@ d@@ ingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
that means that everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , avo@@ i@@ ding , re@@ duc@@ ing .
it &apos;s the first biological ru@@ ck@@ s@@ ack , truly , that was made to be re@@ turned into the life cycle .
and west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ lands , is particularly ra@@ pid in its mel@@ ting .
now i am also older than ch@@ op@@ in when he wrote the piece at thir@@ t@@ y-@@ two .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accu@@ rate .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle things , life is a matter of choice .
you want boot cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; on and on he went .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many bi@@ ologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; exc@@ use me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
when we first sequen@@ ced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accu@@ ra@@ cy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new con@@ ception of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swi@@ mming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ strated ever produced .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the text@@ book .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a pool at a y@@ m@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
i have young film@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors .
we need to have this dialo@@ gue be a more rational , more under@@ stand@@ able dialo@@ gue , including the steps that the government takes .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of .
if we had tw@@ ent@@ y percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the taste , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , sur@@ ely what charles has written is not true .
and if you put it exactly between two equ@@ ally big ha@@ y@@ stac@@ ks , it will star@@ ve .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in ad@@ v@@ ance .
they built this intri@@ cate series of can@@ als , and they pus@@ hed water off the land and out into the river .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is re@@ lie@@ ved with dies@@ el fuel , because you don &apos;t need a licen@@ se for it .
the dies@@ el will be the back@@ -up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
but if you want to ho@@ ok up several of these power in@@ ver@@ ters and they are supposed to constru@@ ct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
that means that if you &apos;re at se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
i was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attac@@ ks based on the attac@@ kers .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate auth@@ ority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gala@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ po@@ late forward .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west for example ?
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
i or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him and asked my collea@@ gue to reas@@ s@@ ess him .
it was running into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into .
if you are a sus@@ pe@@ ct in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be ta@@ pped .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant , called the surge@@ ons .
that our visi@@ ons of technology and design and entertain@@ ment and creativity have to be married with visi@@ ons of humanity , compassion and justice .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
and it was my job , when the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f called for a car@@ di@@ ology consu@@ lt , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
you see , al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ ar aci@@ do@@ sis .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ activ@@ ated con@@ <<unk>> i can@@ on ball .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
a lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more acc@@ essi@@ ble with technology together .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on janu@@ ary fourth and fif@@ th .
see , when you do a google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choo@@ sing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of vie@@ ws and becomes a cultural moment .
part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part broo@@ kl@@ yn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
obviously , this is resul@@ ting in some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic back in@@ ju@@ ries .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have discus@@ sions with you .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden lau@@ ghter swa@@ ying the trees .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fresh from the wild .
i met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
i realized at that point , by conne@@ cting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof .
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , testing the sensor@@ s that open the water .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation .
we took a look at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
so after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fi@@ ction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing ves@@ sel .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
the point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally fe@@ e@@ ds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
my state of al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vi@@ ction .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about sla@@ very .
i tell them about terror@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to world war ii .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless impli@@ cated .
but ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ dation , mar@@ g@@ in@@ alization .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
four years ago here at ted , ray kurz@@ weil and i started a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
it &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent is made of al@@ umin@@ um .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surge@@ on or physi@@ cian or par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said very ma@@ tter@@ -@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
but i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dis@@ h .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well .
and chicago just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
but combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimu@@ lation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
it became a gil@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
and so when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect re@@ a@@ ders all over the world .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all h@@ arb@@ or@@ ed as children .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gical device within the device .
will we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more rob@@ ust and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the span@@ ish .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a lin@@ ear fashion .
so even while studying , you deal with the top@@ ic of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
now there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the usa who &apos;s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ dies@@ el fuel made from al@@ ga@@ e .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a sou@@ p gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
i will cl@@ ari@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attemp@@ t to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtu@@ ality .
we have an abstra@@ ct an abstra@@ cted language .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global warming .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
but it &apos;s an essential compon@@ ent , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutri@@ ents from increasingly distance places .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes down by over nin@@ et@@ y percent .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading liter@@ ature from that period .
today , i play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always trans@@ formed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
and you can inje@@ ct these sounds into a sequence that you can assem@@ ble into the pattern that you want .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participa@@ te than if you only offer five . why ?
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ bo@@ u hi@@ de .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
we can constru@@ ct si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
i think b@@ ach would have been very enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic if he &apos;d had the ton@@ al possibilities that today &apos;s modern pian@@ os have .
and how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
we now have techniques , because of these ra@@ pid metho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
the roman@@ s had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a geni@@ us .
she would catch the po@@ em by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start sing@@ ing on its own .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us-@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us-@@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us-@@ 20 crazy idea .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skep@@ tical .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dra@@ matically .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worl@@ ds than the real world .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s britain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la &apos;s invest@@ ing in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
those who were still around in school , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pped out .
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty to prove that there are predic@@ tors .
i must hon@@ est@@ ly say , and you wit@@ n@@ essed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sha@@ ving machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ onal reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i &apos;m going to play something that i sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly sto@@ le from c@@ elli@@ sts .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predic@@ tors .
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribution , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ishing supply , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resources .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and two days later i came to do my next emergen@@ cy shift , and that &apos;s when my ch@@ ie@@ f asked to speak to me quie@@ tly in her office .
the bottom is trans@@ formed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ air@@ es online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ air@@ es , who made money with their attac@@ ks .
so all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating compon@@ ent .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vor@@ s of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a direc@@ ted attack .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like that od@@ d , still@@ -@@ scre@@ aming bear .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
all those things ste@@ mm@@ ed and started from one place , and for me they ste@@ mm@@ ed and started with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them .
i had a great education -- i &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these muse@@ ums and these art@@ works .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an opportunity to affect one .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is carrying an x chromo@@ some , meeting the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
if you complete the game you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social inno@@ v@@ ator , class of 2010 .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partner@@ ship between those percei@@ ved de@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheel@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ h@@ ill ski@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
we took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
henry , by contr@@ ast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch 1 , 19@@ 80 .
so we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that pers@@ ist that are in many ways proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able .
we &apos;ve done a really good job strug@@ gling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you considered political as@@ yl@@ um instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h-@@ stra@@ pped schools all across america .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty s@@ her@@ i@@ ff who was offen@@ ded that the jan@@ it@@ or had come into court .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they com@@ mit , but do we deser@@ ve to kill ?
now i will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challen@@ ging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
and if they &apos;re on a smar@@ t@@ phone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
and i studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; res@@ iden@@ ce at tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergen@@ cy medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
and i went sa@@ il@@ ing on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the ja@@ va sea .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
and the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and listen@@ ed to the mov@@ ements of my grandmother around the house .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swi@@ mming po@@ ol@@ -@@ sha@@ ped hole underneath the device .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
and the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of choo@@ sing .
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot outside his home in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
my mother , ma@@ i , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two small girls .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
there was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and dar@@ ing .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i just see it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alterna@@ te reality .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same hei@@ ght and in the same type of light .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these a@@ e@@ ds .
we pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ cked them for the three years since .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but used so-@@ called son@@ gl@@ ines , or dre@@ am@@ pa@@ ths
those are the dec@@ lin@@ ing influ@@ ences of the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another s@@ hal@@ low la@@ ke last winter .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and it took place in in co@@ operation with the museum .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many do@@ ors there are .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
so the ancient artist was prote@@ cted from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
and it was expres@@ s@@ ly designed to en@@ able me to discover the outside world , to re@@ discover the real world .
not , if i am environ@@ ment@@ ally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environ@@ ment@@ ally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
and what does intui@@ tive mean and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of perception work and how does cognitive process@@ ing work ?
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a contain@@ er , i can directly see which one con@@ tains s@@ alt and which one con@@ tains pe@@ pp@@ er .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the sp@@ an of milli@@ seconds in which these things happen .
the so-@@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
and so you have someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , saying : there is nothing more important than stabili@@ sing the human population .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of participa@@ tion went down two percent .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you cho@@ se .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choo@@ sing one thing , you &apos;re choo@@ sing not to do other things .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ c@@ tively , and we feel worse .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutri@@ ents .
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophisti@@ cated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
we have trouble fe@@ eding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medi@@ cin@@ es , fuel for the six and a half billion .
now the engineers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
in one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufacturing de@@ fe@@ ct .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consci@@ ously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instin@@ c@@ tively in part .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek re@@ stit@@ ution with its people .
several years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and this resul@@ ted in the first soft@@ -@@ surface character , c@@ g anima@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we re@@ duced it down to a little sum@@ mary .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
but in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , but also in science .
so if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
with time , you will have dem@@ ands and will want to have more sp@@ ices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use the lie as a gran@@ dio@@ se invention to stabili@@ ze our living conditions .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
now we can come up with the second theor@@ em and say : if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , then he has no free will .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experiment@@ al equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange a@@ qua@@ tic plants .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern spa@@ in , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot conc@@ ei@@ ve because the bas@@ eline has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , so i decided to change that .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this thing was .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed a couple things .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
that &apos;s from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is organi@@ zing at mom@@ a later this year , during the summer .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ a@@ ther on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twi@@ t@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bur@@ y them yet .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different an@@ gles .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely repor@@ ted that people assu@@ me that mo@@ s@@ sad is the main enti@@ ty behind this .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ sor and an actu@@ ator .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , bi@@ ologi@@ cally , except in terms of when he was born .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edi@@ tion , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
by cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amo@@ unts to no less than a mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to virtual worl@@ ds and online game environments . &quot;
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identity .
i car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ sta@@ irs where i met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the pre@@ cious dog by the front door .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
this device has the ability to be in a quant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epi@@ c win .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for mana@@ gers to come in , and also an ex@@ ternal legal system .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ et@@ ration of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion , be perfect .
and on this cur@@ ve , ri@@ ding on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we are on a planet that is ba@@ th@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in ad@@ v@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
and one of the things we did at rad@@ b@@ oud university is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a ch@@ ie@@ f listening off@@ ic@@ er .
and then se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ g@@ ged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sau@@ lt me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
we do achieve more in game worl@@ ds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the earth .
but the point is to always find a a really loo@@ se approach to it , to deal with it play@@ fully .
that was really intui@@ tive , i mean , everyone expres@@ sed their wi@@ sh@@ es , their and things that move them .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volu@@ me si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
in the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
arch@@ a@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted in pre-@@ industrial times .
the question is , what will come next ?
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively gra@@ b it and then pass me the s@@ alt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .
around christ@@ mas , in my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
on the one hand there are the practical fun@@ ctions in terms of product language , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gues us .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resi@@ stance .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
i get the entire over@@ view , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ i@@ stic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally com@@ mit su@@ i@@ cide seem to be really und@@ one by their gif@@ ts , you know .
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us rather than having a geni@@ us .
i have this cognitive feedback , you proje@@ cted something you want to see .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
we &apos;re more on the symbo@@ lic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the kni@@ fe .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , in@@ c . right ?
and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world every day .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
they really go through it and create a frame@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
so , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communic@@ ates in a li@@ vely way .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants wei@@ gh four times as much a people .
if you just take these these na@@ pp@@ ies , sh@@ red them , ster@@ ili@@ ze them and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees with it .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise i won &apos;t convince my audience that this is my desire .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cra@@ d@@ le to the gra@@ ve , then our our entire planet will become a ce@@ me@@ tery so@@ on@@ er or later .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or bee@@ f c@@ attle .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
some of you might remember , it was it@@ al@@ y and fr@@ ance playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing d@@ res@@ s-@@ up , or that i re@@ mind them of their se@@ ven@@ -year-old .
my circle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o where i was the class que@@ er .
we have very difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions no@@ wa@@ days -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who ma@@ tter@@ ed .
just as an asi@@ de , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and as of today , we would like to introdu@@ ce this , not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ e@@ u , which is what the product is called , but also a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;m a huge fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
so , for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to a@@ im higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al-@@ world problems .
i &apos;m just going to very brie@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attemp@@ t to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tures .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human lau@@ ghter , dance and ritual .
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more pre@@ cise , more accu@@ rate and quick@@ er .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ ti@@ ments of george bur@@ ns , who was per@@ forming still in las v@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s .
with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours .
or photos like these -- both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ alism .
an epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achie@@ ved it .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tr@@ as@@ h@@ can behind the house .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is literally a million times che@@ aper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educ@@ ated and healthy .
and as i was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hop@@ e@@ ful .
the weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ am@@ ed of such lux@@ u@@ ries .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this glo@@ be , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of un@@ its of this in the developing world .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ e@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ dic@@ ated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
that is for people who can see a marine prote@@ cted area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to res@@ et their bas@@ eline .
and the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mm@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ eting it to my friends .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed ste@@ ad@@ y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
and at that stage , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
and that era of terror@@ ism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of ra@@ cial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and so i jum@@ ped in , i jum@@ ped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the acade@@ mic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there .
sh@@ am@@ ans , p@@ rie@@ sts , so-@@ called kee@@ pers of knowledge , were speci@@ ally as@@ sig@@ ned to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
computer ha@@ cking , and then in the media it &apos;s yes , ha@@ ck@@ ers break into a place and ste@@ al data and so on .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , house of natural fi@@ bers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the acade@@ mic world .
is it logi@@ cal that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteri@@ stic that can &apos;t be learned .
every day you rele@@ ase + you rele@@ ase in the region of two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us and every day you have to absor@@ b two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and sho@@ ot a video .
he transl@@ ated the water@@ li@@ lies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
today a modern orche@@ str@@ a can play anything that was re@@ je@@ cted as un@@ play@@ able at the time .
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wir@@ es can take that current .
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some metaph@@ or@@ ical fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , disaster .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wir@@ es .
today i &apos;d like to verb@@ ally trans@@ late what i usually trans@@ late into music , or interpre@@ t .
and then you ask them how they establi@@ sh their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es we have now .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ ra@@ power , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapi@@ dly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zero .
and so , if you dep@@ end on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , kind of thing .
dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self kee@@ ps for us .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fi@@ ction influence , as a kid .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-@@ being .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cle@@ aner than when it enter@@ ed .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , then you will no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain amount of i@@ d@@ len@@ ess in the network .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
and as we &apos;re here in frank@@ fur@@ t am main , i &apos;ll re@@ mind you of the ma@@ x -@@ plan@@ ck@@ -@@ institute for brain research .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could imple@@ ment a reser@@ vo@@ ir wi@@ sely today .
we can start integr@@ ating electro@@ -@@ mo@@ bility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , in in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories .
if you don &apos;t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ -@@ chemistry .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and respe@@ cted him .
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the exi@@ sting a@@ partment hol@@ ders .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with car st@@ ops , they play with these little weird particles .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of metal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge .
i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
well we can &apos;t all be brand tom , but i do often find myself at the inter@@ section of dark glam@@ or and cas@@ ual fly .
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
i have friends who make great big , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like i make .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
if you think the display on the left is s@@ wing and the display on the right is ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk a@@ verse , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be reward challen@@ ged .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m the trends man@@ ager at youtube , and i profession@@ ally watch youtube videos .
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i de@@ f@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit to you that it makes me nervous .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and fe@@ males in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly toler@@ ant society where f@@ at@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ ger@@ ies is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
again , people of color appe@@ aling to a common@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y over a difference of an@@ atom@@ y , again , success@@ fully .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any i talked about pres@@ ented itself .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this issue .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when i was yo@@ unger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dru@@ cker was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital where i was working .
and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called black@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extin@@ ction , water and energy shor@@ tage -- we sur@@ ely do .
and charles ken@@ ny that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flo@@ wer and then tag it .
so i sig@@ ned the dis@@ charge pa@@ pers , and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce came , par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs came to take her home .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter@@ parts , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
and the fis@@ her@@ ies for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in ghana .
groups like anony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attac@@ ks .
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to ted .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily fa@@ vor the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which i try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
and these are not characteri@@ stics of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertain@@ ment of the future .
he is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ an@@ ced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
so i spoke out on you@@ th un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment and education and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually add@@ ressed to me .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analog@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organisms were turning into multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
to this day , they re@@ main rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and if i say to someone , pass me the s@@ alt or the pe@@ pp@@ er , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which sho@@ ots about this far , two centi@@ me@@ tr@@ es or so .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or so , whereas whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers cost about fif@@ ty euro@@ s .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned posi@@ tively or nega@@ tively on twitter .
and in this other image at the top i have a lec@@ ture in in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen at the medical mus@@ ei@@ on in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the top@@ ic .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , and what does that mean fundament@@ ally .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gras@@ ping .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegan@@ t way , if i know this phenomenon .
that means i can trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly .
we all use it , and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true .
my obje@@ ctive is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , for@@ ty years of the-@@ clu@@ b@@ -@@ of-@@ ro@@ me , into quality .
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
my ja@@ w dro@@ pped , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes ; there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expres@@ sed by the com@@ pos@@ er themselves .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it contra@@ cts in summer .
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drin@@ king g@@ in at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to go there .
and in these in@@ stances , the po@@ em would come up on the page perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
i can trans@@ fer this performance model ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act to an interaction system .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
we try to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but the point is to have a big foot@@ print that &apos;s of use .
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent@@ a@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
and , of course , the he@@ art@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us car@@ ries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
so after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
and very importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at her@@ self in the mirror every day and said , who is the fa@@ i@@ rest of them all ?
the question is just , calcu@@ late that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
he said , &quot; yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone me@@ al , sc@@ ra@@ ps , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed . &quot;
every note , every phr@@ ase is th@@ us given a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from what i &apos;ve personally experienced .
i &apos;d completely closed the loo@@ p between being the science fi@@ ction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
the tough thing is building the pilot re@@ actor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
well bill , i sus@@ pe@@ ct i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electr@@ on@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its as a material .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
so imagine one heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chr@@ ony .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
i feel like i had been held under@@ water , and someone finally reach@@ ed down and pulled my head up so i could brea@@ the . &quot;
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on jun@@ e 1 , 19@@ 80 .
so i told my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot;
any time i &apos;m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine cab@@ in@@ et , you will see ban de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of metal is in two different places .
i was be@@ tting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
now nei@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ com@@ men@@ d for people when you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allo@@ wing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
so , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
and during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we ad@@ ded one little thing .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; a@@ in &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
while chimpanze@@ es are domin@@ ated by big , sc@@ ary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ males .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day , at the ex@@ act same moment , each conc@@ ei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less participa@@ tion rate .
and none of it has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effect .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upp@@ er air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
and i put in my motion that there was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor@@ ial mis@@ condu@@ ct and police mis@@ condu@@ ct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ condu@@ ct .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come a@@ par@@ thei@@ d without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fis@@ her@@ s and this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inje@@ ct this into a patient ...
our system isn &apos;t just being sha@@ ped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the hori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pres@@ um@@ p@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
i was raised in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia to believe those fore@@ sts exi@@ sted to be cut .
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relationship with this work .
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ matically .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
&quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
let me be clear about it . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and it &apos;s just standard sele@@ ction : we can sele@@ ct for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , v@@ acc@@ ine production , etc .
and that &apos;s become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , well , infrastructure cent@@ r@@ es , which are being repres@@ ented all over the world .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
now , that s@@ hal@@ low history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ nia .
he put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it kni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relev@@ ance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
so , in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
and he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
those are the people who are at least offi@@ cially regi@@ ster@@ ed on the website , the di@@ y-@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g-@@ website .
one day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
working with il@@ m , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and self-@@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the fish .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dri@@ ll into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
we &apos;ve been given over ten million fund@@ ed projects , also to atta@@ ch a ten@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ watt battery to the ger@@ man network .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
every single thing we eat , every grain of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a best@@ s@@ eller on the men@@ u .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
and yes , well , i &apos;d just like to motiv@@ ate you , in the sense that it &apos;s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the me@@ al until you need to use the toi@@ let .
these notes are about as pre@@ cise or im@@ pre@@ cise as the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely pre@@ cise .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and relatively naturally .
so you have to exam@@ ine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be impro@@ ved too .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
that means that once a child has reach@@ ed the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life recei@@ ving stories .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ dul@@ um , which has an out@@ put of something like one hundred watt per square me@@ tr@@ e , that was a to@@ y .
people who have never sung con@@ sequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a t@@ one .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any inten@@ tion of building a wall .
because while you are bus@@ y telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predic@@ tors , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
you can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
so the idea is , beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data .
i was the guy be@@ aten up b@@ loo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new a@@ partment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facili@@ t@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasi@@ on i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too over speed , you must open re@@ lief val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participa@@ te when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
some people who have x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cular tissue wra@@ pped around it .
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra@@ g@@ matic at@@ titude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always requi@@ red of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can aug@@ ment it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
but because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks re@@ cep@@ tors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the par@@ king lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
but this is also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olymp@@ ics in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was bush s@@ lan@@ ders and then people actually got to art .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ rus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
and so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for c@@ amer@@ on to do &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster , because after they stabili@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and i hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ s every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fis@@ hed .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ stige to be able to do that .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
in the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist eastern germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
and i cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- as in ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular seas@@ on .
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaning@@ ful , but if you &apos;re a com@@ passionate teacher , they can be especially meaning@@ ful .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w-@@ away ment@@ ality .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year yo@@ unger .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transpor@@ tation , communication have dro@@ pped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ fold .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or both .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
i could also mention ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the usa nobody li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
and then you see that even something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ c@@ test organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c waste to be re@@ turned .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we gu@@ ard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accor@@ d@@ ingly .
that pos@@ es the question as to what is actually the most intui@@ tive performance sche@@ me that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ lin@@ ess than the trans@@ fer@@ al of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the one of the des@@ k@@ top .
their brain waves were then measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the ro@@ om@@ went swi@@ t@@ ched on .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspe@@ cts of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is characteri@@ zed by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
direct adverti@@ sing , and not necessarily for the company pu@@ ma , but to help this company make these products successful .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and te@@ ar , when they break , they can go into biological life cy@@ cles .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s that &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more acc@@ essi@@ ble .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar called je@@ an bu@@ ri@@ dan , and bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass was named after him .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
by not partici@@ p@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compare them to .
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions are going to be refle@@ cted by us as opportunity costs .
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , which which the electric u@@ tili@@ ty on the island , said they think it &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a for@@ um , where you where people can meet and disc@@ uss things online .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reach@@ ing , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
soc@@ rates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
in the descri@@ ption of my pres@@ entation , it is written that i , as an interpre@@ ter , see myself as a transl@@ ator , in the english sense of the word .
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the yo@@ unger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 .
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say , acci@@ dents .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of abstra@@ ction .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us che@@ fs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up fore@@ stry , c@@ ement .
so to make this blin@@ k faster or slo@@ wer , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
and then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vier and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
they cut out the midd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agen@@ cies and said , &quot; maybe these agen@@ cies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious br@@ ands .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the entire film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents ?
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr@@ s. po@@ sten , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upp@@ er ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing in@@ sur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , green@@ land .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i found a few things .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and er@@ ror , a lot of user testing , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the bare essen@@ ti@@ als .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fir@@ es as the assi@@ stant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ mit@@ s .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpo@@ rate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every confidence it will , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will de@@ plo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
number one , how smo@@ oth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , rec@@ ession , depression and bo@@ om time .
and i go to the ja@@ il and i see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
and the room got very quie@@ t , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syste@@ matic killing of human beings .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and that matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
adap@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to rock clim@@ b and even hand@@ cycle .
well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to off@@ ering people more and more choices .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , ster@@ i@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
that whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little c@@ up of coffee or c@@ up of te@@ a and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
even though choo@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
when pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
when i found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the worst days of her life .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
now that &apos;s more impres@@ sive when you consider those magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that li@@ p@@ stick is totally in@@ efficient , but very effective , you see ?
and none of these pl@@ ots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fif@@ ty of them in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years , none of these pl@@ ots was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ a@@ ged .
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user inter@@ faces .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els .
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refle@@ ction , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prote@@ ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct , right ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation over the cent@@ u@@ ries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves .
but i had the good fortun@@ e to meet him at a very young age , when i was thir@@ te@@ en , and so i always atten@@ ded his cour@@ ses while i was at school .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for re@@ moving the dan@@ ger that others create when they set a fire .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resol@@ ution experience .
we &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
if i invi@@ te you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a p@@ ill with offen@@ b@@ ach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in apri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it res@@ on@@ ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and cho@@ sen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve , sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
because now you can imple@@ ment a rule of three .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
one day , los angeles times colum@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and i simply assu@@ me that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the whole world for the next thir@@ ty years .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier which will be hydro@@ gen me@@ than@@ e , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice stat@@ ements were made , which i also was part of .
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , nam@@ ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
so i was trying to per@@ su@@ ade the hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
at the next regul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed ele@@ ction , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a land@@ slide on a platform that promis@@ ed re@@ form , but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those a@@ part@@ ments and the surro@@ unding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the di@@ stra@@ ctions of construction .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follo@@ ws quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
over the course of this film , we had 50@@ 0-@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
but not only are we going to have the brand x ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every categ@@ ory we can in the film .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary up on his offer .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is , i &apos;m out@@ fit@@ -@@ obs@@ essed .
if you keep hit@@ ting the de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means i &apos;m losing you .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine compon@@ ent of hor@@ mon@@ es .
he had x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hell@@ o , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the po@@ uring rain , under an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a , in her pa@@ jam@@ as , bar@@ e@@ foot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than down@@ town boston .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the death of our bodies en@@ ters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
back then , when ar@@ jun@@ a , the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bo@@ w , he &apos;d sho@@ ot it into the ground and water would come out .
the process is fe@@ eding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blocks were manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fix@@ ed measu@@ re@@ ment that fit together .
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like g@@ mail .
and their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would re@@ co@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
she took me out back and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel me hu@@ g@@ ging you ? &quot;
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they exi@@ sted ?
i was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hit@@ ting that de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on over and over and over again .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through -- abstra@@ cting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , pres@@ enting , process@@ ing information .
that could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a g@@ arb@@ age can with an o@@ pos@@ sum in it .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
these might be cou@@ rier services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the a@@ ed that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
so the things that make a photograph look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be enga@@ ged .
i think we would all understand the sen@@ ti@@ ment that woo@@ dy allen expres@@ sed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really un@@ ites everybody , is this fascin@@ ation with technology .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our addi@@ ction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
imagine your your wife is sad , because you up@@ set her , and you turn up with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most su@@ it@@ able pu@@ ri@@ fication plant is the one in frank@@ fur@@ t .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y-@@ five .
and if , as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least .
and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s a relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organis@@ ations , who are doing this more form@@ ally in an institu@@ tion@@ al@@ is@@ ed form already .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty ar@@ is@@ es from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wir@@ eless radio .
here you have the cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which swi@@ t@@ ches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
so he starts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ iety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and for me , the best con@@ temporary example that i have of how to do that is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
when you then move all your fing@@ ers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then t@@ ones come out , which , together , sound like music .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all .
of course , the curi@@ osity , the science compon@@ ent of it -- it was everything . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity , it was imagination .
they can have stron@@ ger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but inten@@ se concent@@ ration , deep , deep focus on tac@@ kl@@ ing a really difficult problem .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
there is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to stab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to att@@ end one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners ton@@ ight .
one such person who opened do@@ ors for me was my childhood doctor at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , del@@ aware .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
she &apos;s one of the organi@@ z@@ ers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a pres@@ entation and present my idea .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
and i understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
over here we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission gui@@ dance system , the c@@ able &apos;s kilometer physics , to illu@@ strate the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior , so to speak , in the network .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt out@@ put and can keep up that out@@ put for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that ma@@ tter@@ ed was the common@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radical thing to do .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the con@@ ception , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that con@@ ception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the par@@ king lot was .
some re@@ f@@ use to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and cru@@ m@@ ble in a fit of dra@@ matic passion .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me $ 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor@@ e the entire week .
he says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain di@@ visi@@ ons .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal be@@ have quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to ki@@ ck out all the other pas@@ sen@@ gers .
play incre@@ ases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experiment@@ al trial going on with v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
the same technology that has produced the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce imm@@ unity against other viruses .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
what if you could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or elimin@@ ate stro@@ ke ?
i came to realize , as a physi@@ cian , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory , just different .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occasi@@ onal inter@@ ruption of the un@@ inten@@ ded forced rus@@ h to the ex@@ it .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-@@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and tre@@ ating them .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
it mix@@ ed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cra@@ ck in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and i wonder@@ ed , maybe i could feel better again .
think about it , that a ma@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile com@@ m than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the obje@@ ctive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subje@@ ctive socie@@ tal opini@@ on of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
in the other , i was en@@ mes@@ hed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally sc@@ ar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and isol@@ ation .
unlike the sett@@ led midd@@ le-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs , whose existence i was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
imagine him as the comm@@ uni@@ sts enter sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
in a world where over two days of video get u@@ plo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and un@@ expected can stand out in the way that these things have .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all@@ -@@ expen@@ s@@ es@@ -@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thou@@ sand@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
this is not like human insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chemi@@ cally indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ cian had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a complete stran@@ ger to my parents .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your being came from you .
we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll exp@@ and in a similar way and also be simil@@ arly net@@ worked , so that more people can get involved .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educ@@ ating themselves really well on it .
this is about the cop@@ ying of genes , repli@@ c@@ ating genes , dna , frag@@ ments , so that you can make them visible .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly describe .
software ha@@ ck@@ ers started building computers in the se@@ venti@@ es and ei@@ gh@@ ties and this gave rise to the internet .
that &apos;s rather sad for the ha@@ cker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and this this ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-@@ industrial times bit@@ ter@@ ly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ ological constru@@ ct to protect you from the results of your work .
and what happened is that we trans@@ fer@@ red the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the the production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ ternal media .
so i went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
opportunity costs sub@@ tra@@ ct from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soc@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embra@@ ce a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
in order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of is@@ lands and so the people had to somehow navi@@ gate through there , from island to island , to find food .
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
a terror@@ ist place , but it was was called wus@@ el@@ tr@@ oni@@ k and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall@@ up survey .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
this isn &apos;t about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government offi@@ cial giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe@@ ar to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to conc@@ ern themselves with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic prototyp@@ es of communication , interaction , etc .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar there , his name is wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes people say , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ ims , there is no free will .
once you &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the com@@ position &apos;s creation .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a vi@@ o@@ lin string .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intui@@ tive as possible , but also with complete transpar@@ ency .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compared to when someone expres@@ ses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak .
so if we look at the development of our society , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed brie@@ fly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
according to bur@@ r@@ elles , the movie pre@@ mi@@ ered in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media impres@@ sions for this film .
now there &apos;s play@@ ful br@@ ands and min@@ d@@ ful br@@ ands , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me court be the court of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ cial system there .
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the con@@ gress in fa@@ vor of this const@@ it@@ u@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
the leader of the con@@ gress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agen@@ cy we talked to ad@@ vis@@ ed their cli@@ ents not to take part .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and i asked the man@@ ager , &quot; is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 ted talk .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of as@@ hes and was placed in my hands .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , carb@@ -@@ fest and all@@ -@@ night s@@ essi@@ ons , tony dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to ada@@ pt to an increasingly challen@@ ging world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the pres@@ entation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
well in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police in apri@@ l 2011 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ pers .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ ager spac@@ ec@@ raft back towards the earth , in 199@@ 0 after it just passed saturn ?
when i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lux@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ as@@ h@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
for every nine people who have been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and rele@@ ased from death row .
i spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
so an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
but these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
there , the focus is on how to approach people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use inter@@ active media and can come to the most satis@@ fying result possible .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to act as if the first theor@@ em were fal@@ se from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any pro@@ of .
i was se@@ vent@@ e@@ en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of ch@@ op@@ in &apos;s four bal@@ la@@ ds , one of his later works .
it always makes for a happy conc@@ ert when i have the fortun@@ e to experience the piece an@@ e@@ w , even though i &apos;ve been working on it for so long in ad@@ v@@ ance .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in it@@ al@@ y throw out a can of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a from their car window .
and many discus@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thir@@ ty years re@@ gar@@ ding photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e pus@@ hed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about for@@ ty to six@@ ty bar .
and that was then it &apos;s not bin@@ ding , but it &apos;s yes , i think it has managed to become accep@@ ted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had helped you .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , addi@@ tional construction of co@@ al-@@ burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not possible .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing life .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
but here &apos;s the thing that kee@@ ps me up at night -- one of the things that kee@@ ps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ ver@@ sity as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ cans , who then led to the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , that is a lie .
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machin@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and sometimes , a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the waste quite dra@@ matically as you &apos;re going through this process .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ tory , doing &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
we want to encoura@@ ge a world of cre@@ ators , of inv@@ ent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ yp@@ ical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and it &apos;s that play@@ ful curi@@ osity that dri@@ ves us to explore , dri@@ ves us to interact , and then the un@@ expected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy the@@ ori@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging a different , color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit for every single occasi@@ on .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is bat@@ tles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
i had a lot of journ@@ alists calling me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of lo@@ gic to string together these complex ideas .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ ver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ kle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self .
are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , sec@@ ure , sac@@ red , con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive or wise like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was ex@@ ecu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately je@@ wish ?
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
what about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ fes@@ pan has more than dou@@ bled , average per capit@@ a income ad@@ ju@@ sted for inf@@ lation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
so those are just a few of the cli@@ ps i colle@@ cted over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
unlike the one-@@ way entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , this community participa@@ tion is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or by doing something new with it .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
and because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
so an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institution of government .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically .
so i got a ti@@ cket for not ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it che@@ cks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
and i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the trans@@ lation of liter@@ ature or even poetry .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classi@@ cal software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
intui@@ tive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an element@@ ary economic factor , an element@@ ary success factor , when apple appe@@ ared on the scene , if i wanted to make technologi@@ cal devices us@@ able for people .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff@@ air with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the exten@@ sion of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
at the media cam@@ pus , for example , we are attemp@@ ting to ren@@ der virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything that can be inclu@@ ded in that , like syn@@ thetic biology , etc .
i can make b@@ ach &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a b@@ aro@@ que har@@ p@@ sich@@ ord was not able to .
at this point and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ration@@ ally .
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the u@@ tter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must trans@@ late these im@@ pre@@ cise indi@@ cations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al musical language .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
you st@@ are out at a hori@@ zon that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this thi@@ ck , rich mar@@ s@@ hl@@ and .
b@@ g : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y .
so , the other grade is : are we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we de@@ plo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c roman@@ ce , passionate film . &quot;
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this sat@@ u@@ ration of c@@ g movies and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to mor@@ ally justi@@ fy something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a vi@@ o@@ lin lesson with me .
up ti@@ ll now the following is always argu@@ ed in discus@@ sions , these is@@ lan@@ ders are becoming self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our jo@@ int network .
and our european energy grid basically consi@@ sts of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the ax@@ le always revol@@ ves around the whole of europe .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , where we could pre@@ cis@@ ely re@@ constru@@ ct , so to speak , the electrical ra@@ ti@@ o of the island on a one to three scale .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
and i made myself a bar@@ gain that if only i re@@ double my eff@@ or@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home .
and as far as isol@@ ation goes , when we as a species do col@@ oni@@ ze dist@@ ant planets , there will be the isol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
and by the way , we im@@ migra@@ te and circu@@ late and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the notion of happiness .
it &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doctor approach@@ es -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
but for over two weeks , we progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the ven@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ s@@ est to doing what i wanted . &quot;
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
in sending her home , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ di@@ a@@ c surge@@ on or a nur@@ se prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surge@@ on , an ob@@ gy@@ n , a par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to be ?
when this device sequences an r@@ na or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the c@@ d@@ c and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mic from happening in the first place .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vot@@ ing rights act .
so of course , random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
and in that bon@@ d , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
my first memor@@ ies are from the boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the bo@@ w di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented all the various tas@@ ks that these ce@@ os enga@@ ged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk . &quot;
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ v@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people dep@@ end .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridi@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative approach@@ es .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , conver@@ t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
and because they work so much harder physi@@ cally than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amo@@ unts to that of thir@@ ty billion people .
we only have phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years and phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing worldwide is already em@@ it@@ ting a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
and they will they have been increasingly over@@ written during the course of the cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera .
they look at biological materials in an arti@@ stic way and , yes , also electr@@ onic tin@@ ker@@ ing , and com@@ bine this in a very out@@ land@@ ish way .
one should eat the food that is lo@@ v@@ ingly coo@@ ked by a co@@ ok , not just look at it or pass on the reci@@ pe for it .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the sou@@ l exists or not .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteri@@ stics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
it got expres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote reach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical pal@@ ette will have many more nu@@ an@@ ces of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that makes that very production possible .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cu@@ e if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
but we found ourselves la@@ g@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually fo@@ unded the company to do .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the s@@ hal@@ low oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and cla@@ ims and is th@@ us of un@@ sound mind .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it : fish far@@ ms po@@ ll@@ ute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
so you &apos;re notic@@ ing a change is taking place , from a defen@@ sive at@@ titude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es is right .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use tw@@ ent@@ y percent dies@@ el fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
and if you want to ex@@ ce@@ ed tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , you have to switch off dies@@ el .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architec@@ ts , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting we@@ t .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this categ@@ ory into the positive , versus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and we@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pres@@ sing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just quant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed into a tiny space .
now in fact , you had obje@@ c@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would vent@@ ure to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these ad@@ vent@@ ures wearing nothing new .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing like my own personal tre@@ as@@ ure h@@ unt .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ var@@ ies inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has te@@ stes inside , and she has a y chromo@@ some .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing brea@@ sts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody fig@@ ures out something &apos;s up here .
the fellow pas@@ sen@@ gers for in@@ anima@@ te objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
now in our town , where the volunte@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a highly sk@@ ill@@ ed career staf@@ f , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ dness of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
in fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated more chemicals and divi@@ ded more .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fe@@ eding growth where you go by orders of magni@@ tude every few years .
and i went through the same period of sh@@ ame and rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surge@@ on who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing with qu@@ al@@ com@@ m foundation something called the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to com@@ mit ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this si@@ x-@@ pack of be@@ er -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the wo@@ ods .
and most pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to in@@ her@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wi@@ sely ?
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing ci@@ vi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
i have ste@@ pped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and trou@@ bled children caught between two worl@@ ds .
and there were rare but se@@ aring chan@@ ts of &quot; sli@@ t-@@ eye &quot; and the occasi@@ onal gra@@ ff@@ iti : &quot; asi@@ an , go home . &quot;
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying a y chromo@@ some , meeting that x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the kog@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that since we because of these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual man@@ ner , although we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
it could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizar@@ re collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ ternal thing that was not quite tom .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ ba class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ o@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings .
at that time , there were self-@@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in <<unk>> z@@ berg in mehr@@ ing@@ h@@ of , where people thought evil took place .
and then i went to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties because i wanted to study rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and they didn &apos;t have that in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he .
at the moment we &apos;re growing cor@@ n and losing between el@@ even and thir@@ ty kil@@ ogra@@ ms thir@@ ty ton@@ nes per he@@ ct@@ are , if you were to calcu@@ late it per square me@@ tr@@ e .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emplo@@ yer or who@@ ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
people believed that creativity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really magni@@ fi@@ cent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
you know , and what is it specifically about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze individual freedom .
and of course the stories that i cho@@ se to tell were science fi@@ ction stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high tru@@ ck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze under . &quot;
for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
this app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it ada@@ pt to us as well as we ada@@ pt to it .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fund@@ ing for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le .
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epidemic of autis@@ m to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine shot .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
it dem@@ ands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
and it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quie@@ t , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
i have a company that does design and anima@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is definitely an intri@@ cate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many direc@@ tions .
and part of me also wonder@@ s , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ mr@@ i ?
now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
and the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preser@@ ve a lot of genes that would otherwise be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ moved from the population .
we have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s : bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gent optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have de@@ vot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
one , we bat@@ ter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the in@@ sur@@ ance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighborhood in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
given who we were and how life had sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
two years later i was an atten@@ ding in the emergen@@ cy department at a community hospital just north of tor@@ onto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at .
and at the end of the day , i pac@@ ked up to leave the hospital and walked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m .
so , i suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand part@@ ners that they have .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vi@@ bra@@ te and not vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with muse@@ ums and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an adverti@@ sing effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
what is particularly impres@@ sive in the area of inter@@ active media is the fact that we &apos;ve an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed the ability to think in a non-@@ lin@@ ear way in our biological memory .
according to the auth@@ or of the book the story@@ telling animal , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ tsch@@ all , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the re@@ ception of stories .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ ft@@ ables , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ d@@ ingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this ro@@ se-@@ tin@@ ted area .
it means that when we can see that we can trans@@ fer exi@@ sting performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vi@@ ral particles .
we can go to watch our kid play soc@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , on our la@@ ps .
another example is so-@@ called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my pres@@ entation , we are physi@@ cally moving in non-@@ exist@@ ent , virtual worl@@ ds there , according to the example of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
and that is kind of our vision of sensi@@ ble energy use and i am gr@@ ate@@ ful to the cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le institute that they said , use solar power .
and we &apos;re just trying to demon@@ strate that we can de@@ cre@@ ase the capac@@ i@@ ties , the mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties , by putting electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the network too .
now , having sel@@ ec@@ ted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respond to that are time magazine people of the year .
and we ro@@ unded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pet for as far as you could see .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t po@@ ll@@ ute . &quot;
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
only things that are subject to wear and te@@ ar , such as sho@@ e sol@@ es , bra@@ ke co@@ ver@@ ings , car ty@@ r@@ es , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , called ab@@ b today , in the se@@ venti@@ es , and was then licen@@ sed to the japanese .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quanti@@ ties .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , for@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citi@@ zen .
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ a@@ king idea how i was going to c@@ ash .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to lo@@ cate in the americ@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
by not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; ap@@ es since they have frequ@@ ent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ ex@@ ual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let us embra@@ ce this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ lo@@ w@@ ship and wonder .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , &quot; wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is f@@ ed with pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded video .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
so for those people who did choose to participa@@ te , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
all the dollars were allo@@ cated and extra tu@@ i@@ tion in english and mathematics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what mis@@ sed out , which was usually new clo@@ th@@ es ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that kee@@ ps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have pl@@ ent@@ y for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ her@@ it the tra@@ its of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your i@@ pad out with the video on and through aug@@ mented reality , you see this layer of anima@@ ted pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a hou@@ se@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
perhaps the exi@@ sting model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
when a child gro@@ ws up in an environment where the adults ac@@ tively make music or at least ac@@ tively li@@ stens to music , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flo@@ wer ?
na@@ than@@ iel dro@@ pped out of ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row in down@@ town los angeles .
a collea@@ gue of mine got access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and lo@@ gic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
a project i set up myself with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , was one in which we wanted to create a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical t@@ wee@@ z@@ ers .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
these are the first shoes with which you make a jac@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit start at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an lights and the ru@@ b@@ ber so@@ le can go into biological cy@@ cles , okay ?
there are different gra@@ des here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it passi@@ vely or whether you can also ac@@ tively speak it , all the way to the musical na@@ tive speak@@ er .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
the nice thing about this top@@ ic is that on this island , you can basically anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall or on sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ cious -- and i don &apos;t like fish skin ; i don &apos;t like it se@@ ared , i don &apos;t like it cris@@ p@@ y .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
and the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
and it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergen@@ cy physi@@ cians i know dre@@ ad .
ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative partici@@ p@@ ating communities , complete un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness , these are characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popul@@ ar@@ ity .
so if transpor@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a tax@@ i ca@@ b and be in to@@ k@@ yo in 30 seconds .
it started with a question by the ma@@ yo@@ r of the city , who came to us saying that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in apri@@ l of this year , at the ge@@ ffen mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the b@@ ad@@ -@@ as@@ ses of the street art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ka@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
the one little thing we ad@@ ded was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consi@@ stent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those defini@@ tions .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease ...
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one string of dna .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
for the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar-@@ gener@@ ated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel@@ -@@ gener@@ ated electricity in india -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t disappe@@ ar , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organic eli@@ te .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te por@@ tion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
this picture on the left is of bio@@ curious , that &apos;s a ha@@ cker@@ space , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit <<unk>> institution , where anybody can go to .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
and even if they &apos;re all shu@@ t off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a soc@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
now of course , in a way those acci@@ dents rei@@ gni@@ te the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to re@@ f@@ ute .
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural an@@ x@@ iety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , then your consciousness is inje@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
children , el@@ der@@ ly people , all sorts of people go there to simply exam@@ ine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory proto@@ col@@ s .
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satis@@ fying way possible .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct , and it took months to understand how to hand@@ le these systems .
and then it can leave you .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
the dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gra@@ y box if a specific con@@ figu@@ ration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target .
but the nin@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the nin@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce .
this year we celebra@@ te the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illu@@ strated , i think , a truth about the human character .
do you realize that we can take advantage and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the machin@@ ery of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of human insu@@ lin used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics ?
i want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes wheel@@ chair users up standing and walking again .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achie@@ ved , or are on their way to achie@@ ving , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mit@@ ted because of a very va@@ gue concept of birth@@ right .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it .
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to court and pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named er@@ ik micha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drin@@ king water a day out of any source -- sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two cents a li@@ ter .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
the re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
his name was dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an itali@@ an american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americans to pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
one of the interesting impli@@ cations on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , like po@@ uring a color the way we might po@@ ur a liquid .
and if you have another opportunity to en@@ act this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don &apos;t re@@ mind them of their self-@@ de@@ ception .
work -- we are bl@@ essed , as car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest goals of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
we wri@@ ters , we kind of do have that repu@@ tation , and not just wri@@ ters , but creative people across all gen@@ r@@ es , it seems , have this repu@@ tation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
if the di@@ v@@ ine , cock@@ e@@ yed geni@@ us as@@ sig@@ ned to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; o@@ le ! &quot;
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ ft@@ ables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and i can use them to po@@ ur color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the refle@@ ctive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
we should go through these efficiency meas@@ ures to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions : the less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the s@@ wis@@ s bank account of mr. sam ja@@ in right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the ra@@ w land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
so as you all rec@@ all , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing power of networks , to the physical one .
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought at the ven@@ ice beach bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , some cop@@ per wire and some stuff from home de@@ po@@ t and radio sha@@ ck .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ and@@ ing and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws .
so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called digital do@@ main .
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
so every morning i ho@@ p on my wi@@ f@@ i scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in confidence was i that i actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
now we can do it in a more pre@@ cise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vi@@ tam@@ in a into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in .
if they become more intui@@ tive and then i have to rough@@ -@@ hand@@ le my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spee@@ ding up evolution with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
we all know that inter@@ active media is , by definition , non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the ne@@ gation of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and which of course tells us that we consider lin@@ ear@@ ity normal today .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imag@@ ining a number of person@@ s people jum@@ ping around in front of some game con@@ sol@@ es or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game con@@ so@@ le .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the top@@ ic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the top@@ ic of the relationship between man and object of course .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- b@@ ass , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , e@@ el -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely rever@@ sed the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction .
o@@ sit in itself is used by us fif@@ ty to se@@ vent@@ y thousand times depen@@ ding on the activity , it was as@@ certain@@ ed that when you sleep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day .
and if you den@@ y people the if you den@@ y people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to proper@@ ly use these little mus@@ cles that att@@ une the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds .
and when this breath of air po@@ urs out onto a human , the human is filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with mind , with nature that can only live with a sou@@ l .
and if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the ima@@ gery ?
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
can i give them a bo@@ w in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the vast hori@@ zon that guar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
i approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making portra@@ its of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the boo@@ ster rock@@ ets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , collea@@ gue universi@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these a@@ e@@ ds all around the world .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanis@@ ms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corpo@@ rate ex@@ ecu@@ tive . &quot;
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chromo@@ some .
well , when there are lots of alterna@@ tives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of alterna@@ tives that you re@@ je@@ ct , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ chair users , but for everyone .
b@@ g : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
when you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ o@@ ma@@ ble technology to every single web page like this .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
it &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ actor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sti@@ cks of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , one y@@ ard of ta@@ pe , one y@@ ard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
none of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
first of all , for children in the united states 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ hol on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way .
it turns out that in weg@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ es up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of maga@@ zin@@ es all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your history .
and as a con@@ sequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as we &apos;ve had before .
you see the image of the place called cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since ro@@ man times , people go to celebra@@ te , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
the small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ ca@@ de , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and mani@@ pul@@ ating val@@ ves .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conver@@ sa@@ tions with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
bus@@ h@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small sta@@ dium with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
i would like to invi@@ te all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
but what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents how a new generation is tac@@ kl@@ ing the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action .
i &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully con@@ struc@@ ting a similar mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analog@@ y to it .
and it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that i believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tion@@ ing and cars .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dro@@ pped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
i or@@ dered a kid@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my collea@@ gue who was doing a reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant and called the surge@@ ons .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with te@@ stes who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her k@@ nee jo@@ in@@ ts , that move her forward in this kind of smo@@ oth and very natural ga@@ it .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of knowledge surro@@ unding the com@@ pos@@ er as an interpre@@ ter , and you listen to them regul@@ arly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the com@@ pos@@ er .
it &apos;s like experi@@ en@@ cing a happy new day af@@ res@@ h , even though you go through the same ritu@@ als , getting up , having break@@ fast , going to work , i experience the same piece an@@ e@@ w again and again .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that i hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in l@@ ength -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it roll@@ s it back@@ wards .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tri@@ b@@ al society .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions ; why does someone spend such hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous su@@ ms of money on such a little bag that you can har@@ dly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practical ?
because you can &apos;t smell the flo@@ wers in the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , you can &apos;t guess the sha@@ de of green , you can &apos;t hear or feel the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing of the wind .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the in@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to establi@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
i &apos;m a day older , the seas@@ ons change , my pul@@ se is slo@@ wer in the ev@@ ening than it is in the morning , in a conc@@ ert hall it takes longer for the rever@@ ber@@ ation to return than it does at home .
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illu@@ strate this .
you can he@@ ed the share by using one of these smart gri@@ ds , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &apos;ll never be able to do without the reser@@ vo@@ ir completely .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and so in this sense we &apos;re coming together , also if you look at the pres@@ entation by pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that it &apos;s okay to be a collective and use solar power .
it &apos;s a river that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical cont@@ amin@@ ants , pe@@ sti@@ cide run@@ off .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that i had imag@@ ined from reading these books .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment simply can &apos;t support .
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to ris@@ d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
i have in my po@@ cket a check made out to the par@@ ent organization to the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be applied toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s ted .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a goo@@ se with a stick on sh@@ ro@@ ve tu@@ es@@ day .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently invest@@ ing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magni@@ tude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astron@@ aut , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ ct , and they all have something to do to save the world .
we are talking here about , o@@ f@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the wheel@@ chair &apos;s the only option .
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a work@@ shop was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , ta@@ ps , opening and clo@@ sing .
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy prote@@ sting bi@@ cycle fin@@ es in new york city , i ad@@ mit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the se@@ c &apos;s requ@@ est for com@@ ment on the financial re@@ form bill .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the still@@ -@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
and i asked last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble that people died because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
another thing from the usa that also had to do with pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test thing , is the the p@@ c@@ r , the poly@@ mer@@ ase chain reaction , a complicated term .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , colle@@ cted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satelli@@ te images and so on , but from the collective memory .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt assu@@ mption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legi@@ ti@@ mate scientific sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ ons about the notion of , basically fa@@ i@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
and we started talking about music , from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven and bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the b &apos;s , from bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ onen .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomen@@ al phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than when i am able to make these things acc@@ essi@@ ble via hier@@ arch@@ ically organis@@ ed web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms so to speak .
that &apos;s why i pre@@ fer to do it all in ger@@ man , because if i &apos;d have to trans@@ late it into english , that would be like the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
to show you how slowly this mechan@@ ism disappe@@ ars and to illu@@ strate the tra@@ ces it leaves , which lead to something other than this gran@@ dio@@ se image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a sou@@ l .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-@@ called state tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents .
and whenever you are in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed which can save lives .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cular recogni@@ tion technology , but i just recogni@@ zed something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pp@@ er part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fra@@ c@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the mas@@ ses ?
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce note .
so i pres@@ ented another fac@@ t-@@ filled lec@@ ture that inclu@@ ded a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transpor@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m@@ s. par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpo@@ ra@@ tions and governments could only do in the past .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ fe@@ cated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wir@@ eless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also ha@@ ck into it , that &apos;s it , and i thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del@@ ve into that .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an ee@@ g or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans i had ever had .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vi@@ tt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americ@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating spa@@ tial relationships .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by steve sei@@ tz at u.@@ w .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely dist@@ ant ones , for professional staf@@ f , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with a doctor &apos;s degree et@@ c. only .
the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines .
so that &apos;s currently the the core obje@@ ctive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ bility , so that that more people can get involved .
okay ? there we are slo@@ g@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
this is a condition in which the heart fa@@ ils , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the l@@ ung@@ s fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .
imagine you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at em@@ c , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ bay .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ style evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot;
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h-@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a not@@ e@@ book that is used by a ma@@ inten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gra@@ y box , then we are in business .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wra@@ pped in the ad@@ ver@@ sity .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kil@@ o@@ watt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
we &apos;re challen@@ ging teams around the world to basically com@@ bine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a@@ .@@ i@@ . , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and when i listen@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear cra@@ ck@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ us@@ hed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cr@@ us@@ hed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity and our in@@ na@@ te ability to imagine .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ astern ecu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing was bad .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intui@@ tive or naturally mana@@ ge@@ able as possible .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it fun@@ ctions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed prac@@ tically everything that could be developed electr@@ on@@ ically and in terms of software between the individual systems .
there is ad@@ ver@@ sity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ ver@@ sity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so eng@@ aging , and immer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pas@@ s@@ words .
simply by virtu@@ e of the fact that mary was born pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in the con@@ gress to am@@ end their const@@ it@@ ution to have a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be remin@@ ded of how horri@@ ble the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capac@@ i@@ ties -- that better memory .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t .
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
we there put out six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sam@@ ple some ja@@ m ?
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in my an@@ atom@@ y class the orig@@ ins and exer@@ tions of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ d@@ ologi@@ cally .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of c@@ ameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone c@@ ameras to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , stit@@ ched together in this environment .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occu@@ pi@@ ed for three seconds .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determin@@ ed by the larger ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack that immediately attra@@ cts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electr@@ on@@ ics sector where you also find a whole tin@@ ker@@ er scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circu@@ its .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which origin@@ ally comes from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , and it &apos;s a network based in europe with a co@@ operation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
and what you can do with it and approach@@ ing society very tar@@ ge@@ ted@@ ly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at oni@@ ons and made them light up and stuff like that .
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
as the note is anything but a pre@@ cise indi@@ cation of the desire of a com@@ pos@@ er , and is , rather , a frame@@ work , i will now u@@ tili@@ se this frame@@ work to fill it with sense and meaning .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ f@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a view port .
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medic@@ ation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , caus@@ ing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
anyone who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ cis@@ ely this way .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing .
where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in ber@@ lin .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an x@@ y chromo@@ so@@ mal basis , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chromo@@ some tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the fe@@ tal life , to become te@@ stes .
but , in the previous in@@ stances of those thes@@ au@@ rus ent@@ ries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ s , believed that to u@@ tter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into existence .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the promise of the children ?
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve .
they dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly gest@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
if you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fu@@ els which are dri@@ ll@@ ed out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enzy@@ me found naturally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ t@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of metal is free to act however it wanted .
the other hat that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow lab@@ rad@@ ors that i know that are more capable of in@@ formed , intelligent , ma@@ ture decisions about sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
let me now introdu@@ ce you to ele@@ gs that is wor@@ n by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel that 19 years ago was spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ red , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ astern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of to@@ ma@@ to@@ es .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
but that &apos;s the ni@@ c@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because bacteria communicate .
so those are the three main attac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anony@@ mous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks .
here was some law@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living cre@@ ature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spi@@ ritual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worl@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm exten@@ si@@ vely instead of just intensi@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produ@@ cers , but experts in relationships .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together auto@@ matically .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and satis@@ fied , in a narra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water cre@@ ature , we actually embra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mes@@ sages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distin@@ ct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mr@@ i &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commer@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my avo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ fi@@ ghter , i am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness on a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al scale , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
most fe@@ males like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chromo@@ so@@ mal ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ males like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very b@@ ad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
i don &apos;t need to get emotion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , color@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor re@@ f@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ ologist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on angi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
and i came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .
and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villa@@ ges and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ vable scale and un@@ belie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
not burning the bio@@ soli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cy@@ cles in the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation plant , but asking on@@ es@@ el@@ f , how do you close cy@@ cles ?
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
there are other services like how we make ferti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dra@@ matic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intelle@@ ct and reason .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
immediately after that vote , on febru@@ ary 21@@ st to the 24@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
i always keep my thes@@ au@@ rus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the de@@ vil , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the ad@@ vice that designers must also think differently to arri@@ ve at new solutions , and so i thank you war@@ m@@ ly for your attention and please .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen@@ cing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &quot;
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based reaction .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ ologi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is brand@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
i became en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
in spa@@ in , when a perfor@@ mer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , o@@ le , o@@ le , al@@ la@@ h , magni@@ fi@@ cent , bra@@ vo , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ ble , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natu@@ re-@@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mit@@ s our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .
that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
henry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jum@@ ps on this cur@@ ve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
i started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ anz and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de , and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start fall@@ ing apart ?
now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ cise sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s projects by michael bur@@ k , an@@ n-@@ ka@@ thr@@ in kr@@ enz , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z <<unk>> ll@@ er .
and then the fo@@ under of do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g came and said : okay
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ than@@ e by micro@@ bes .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cloud .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , ha@@ cked it open , moun@@ ted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ alt with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ alt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concep@@ ts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of h@@ h@@ s who &apos;s saying , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammo@@ gra@@ ms , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee en@@ em@@ as .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te becomes the god .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
but that &apos;s my my prototyp@@ e , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran@@ ch and that , that thing on it , put the electr@@ on@@ ics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neu@@ ral model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o@@ .@@ k. -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what pro@@ fil@@ ers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they make these imple@@ ment this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like that .
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it kni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven offi@@ cially re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ ed senses , and in the near future the next , the ei@@ gh@@ th sense will probably be ad@@ ded to it and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my belo@@ ved old teacher professor j@@ <<unk>> gen u@@ de , a well-@@ known bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and lon@@ g@@ standing professor at the conser@@ v@@ atory here in stu@@ tt@@ g@@ art .
we look into this network , see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ tz , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again .
and in a mira@@ cle , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ lin and he started playing , by ear , certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ sohn , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to ad@@ mit , that there are some golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ stac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon@@ dur@@ as .
in order to get target theor@@ ies , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been repor@@ ted .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in for@@ mul@@ a 1 ra@@ cing over the past couple of decades .
and what we know from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ males , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surge@@ on i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name for himself .
we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so b@@ old and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store to set up a stere@@ o system -- speak@@ ers , c@@ d player , ta@@ pe player , tun@@ er , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototyp@@ es , suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve prototyp@@ es , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototyp@@ es along the way .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fest itself in writing , meaning that i took something flu@@ id and alive and started to car@@ ve it in stone and so manipu@@ late it .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as was@@ hing po@@ w@@ der enzy@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h clo@@ th@@ es at for@@ ty degrees , which are also gene@@ tically optimis@@ ed enzy@@ mes .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling c@@ at li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs .
i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that i was born into a world that percei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of americans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- below an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ...
this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; re@@ adi@@ ly understood ; characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility or acc@@ essi@@ bility of information , especially concern@@ ing business practic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to men@@ d , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
so we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in se@@ attle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has ra@@ ged for decades and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra@@ cing it , gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ rest@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five-@@ thir@@ ty percent ex@@ cess energy , so we have to li@@ mit the wind and sun .
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water t@@ ank , inside , so they can go back to a cell@@ u@@ lose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fif@@ ty trees in israel or tun@@ isi@@ a with one baby .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely trans@@ formed itself from a calcul@@ ator to a digital assi@@ stant .
i think that inter@@ active media address arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were progra@@ mm@@ ed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be e@@ lic@@ ited through inter@@ active media .
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her , and she grab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
tan le , anony@@ mous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was now tan le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , invited to speak in ven@@ u@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imag@@ ined .
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment there is -- for the thri@@ ll of discovery , and for that strange bon@@ d that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly kn@@ it team .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
what if you could change the sper@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ate the diabetes , elimin@@ ate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lic and can survive at the ste@@ am vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de coo@@ ked fish , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , have managed to make that a hospit@@ able environment for them .
the great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tic@@ ist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an es@@ say that he ti@@ t@@ led &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gling it too much .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- balance .
you know , geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a transl@@ ator can &apos;t just simply ren@@ der a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation can occu@@ r .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pic@@ ted the ge@@ ology and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region and that of course also made it possible to de@@ frag@@ ment these songs and re@@ ar@@ range them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
now how many times have we ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader ele@@ cted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned evolution@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensor@@ s -- so for example , from pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke input data .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fir@@ es when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bled demand and things like that .
but i do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the mal@@ ay@@ si@@ an coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ ib@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
and then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that kee@@ ps sc@@ ore , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then disappe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ as@@ hed upon him .
when we look at its me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and was@@ hed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sever@@ e sho@@ ck .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ cian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan in new york and la sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fl@@ y@@ fire .
so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terror@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ mir kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.@@ s .
so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly horri@@ ble situations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine socie@@ tal issues in a way that make them eng@@ aging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertain@@ ing and acc@@ essi@@ ble to an audience .
but with only one company , one agen@@ cy willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ <<unk>> for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the midd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ var@@ ies and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that stun@@ ning display .
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
and they will get heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better educ@@ ated by using the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by literally being able to use 3d prin@@ ting and infin@@ ite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sex@@ ually attra@@ cted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ dered , unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angeles to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , brilliant , ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musi@@ cian .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscop@@ e .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented con@@ temporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized .
and he &apos;s spee@@ ding along , and all of a sudden he he@@ ars this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tali@@ zing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
there are technical concep@@ ts such as <<unk>> aug@@ mented reality <<unk>> .
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how play both requires trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fi@@ ction fan .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sh@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
those are it has a more ar@@ ty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s are working , together with scientists , on exam@@ ining these technologies and asking questions and process@@ ing the knowledge crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .
with its complete transpar@@ ency , which is the new kind of thinking that clas@@ hes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the las@@ ag@@ ne and not bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , because i want to cover that up and not conf@@ ess to it .
and when you see how far re@@ moved we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , has a program to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l by tw@@ ent@@ y for@@ ty , right ?
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
so , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing for , but off i went -- up the sta@@ irs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes .
up at@@ tribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful , being fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , con@@ temporary , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , ed@@ g@@ y or dar@@ ing like er@@ ro@@ l fl@@ yn@@ n , ni@@ m@@ ble or agi@@ le , pro@@ fan@@ e , dom@@ ine@@ ering , ma@@ gical or my@@ sti@@ cal like gand@@ al@@ f .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything i can , from one of the first artic@@ les i wrote for the tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
not by the lat@@ est com@@ bine and tra@@ ctor invention , but by ferti@@ le land ; not by pump@@ s , but by fresh water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by fore@@ sts ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
feed grain to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re fe@@ eding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous red@@ und@@ ant op@@ tions , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .
but we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adverti@@ ser would normally never get behind .
and , one day , he came in to my s@@ ession -- ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ essi@@ ons -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . ai@@ mee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those b@@ ands .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ il@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sation , international best@@ s@@ eller thing .
and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conven@@ tional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fif@@ ty cents per k@@ w@@ h after tw@@ ent@@ y years , you &apos;d arri@@ ve at about fort@@ y-@@ four cents .
and our a@@ im was , we wanted to reach se@@ vent@@ y to nin@@ et@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ ent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from bat@@ ter@@ ies won &apos;t work either .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos@@ ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
but the process , and the heavy an@@ x@@ iety around it was rele@@ ased when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trouble , and rele@@ ased it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its simpli@@ city , or alterna@@ tively , we inv@@ o@@ ke th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
but we don &apos;t even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted colle@@ c@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
because we want this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being brilliant , des@@ cen@@ ded from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un@@ predic@@ table as an organis@@ m that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ lin pas@@ sage work in the last movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been de@@ plo@@ yed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s colle@@ cted anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ tig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
i wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfort of life in an uns@@ ung sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters en@@ ding each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qua@@ int and color@@ ful but somehow re@@ duced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
i then tried to exp@@ and this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test , so dna finger@@ prin@@ ting in other words , at home again .
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and then you end up in one of these ph@@ ases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand <<unk>> mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uni@@ form pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
fir@@ stly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of ex@@ cre@@ tions you have , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your po@@ tty and sti@@ r its cont@@ ents , your curi@@ osity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i divi@@ de them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus i show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and divi@@ de them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choo@@ sing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can rele@@ ase the power of so many more children , and invi@@ te them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce .
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact with vast amo@@ unts of visual data .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web@@ c@@ am , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led it , took off the l@@ ens , turned it around and then we have a microscop@@ e , which has a four hundred fold magni@@ fication appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely .
this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then tra@@ pped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virg@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to in@@ form the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organis@@ ed these these little actions at street festi@@ v@@ als and tried to explain dna to people .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
i was reading this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the as@@ sau@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ hed .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ sur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ c@@ ement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ str@@ ust .
and so with this pre@@ mis@@ es with this pre@@ mis@@ es , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini@@ -@@ laboratory , took a pressure coo@@ ker , a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and b@@ red bacteria with it , working like this .
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organis@@ ed two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shor@@ tly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ sting species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ it@@ ation .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
cloud computing , what my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call infin@@ ite computing ; sensor@@ s and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3d prin@@ ting , which is the ability to democra@@ ti@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; syn@@ thetic biology ; fu@@ els , vac@@ cin@@ es and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ o@@ materials ; and a@@ .@@ i .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these thi@@ ck , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than anything -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
and the conversation i had with de@@ an kamen this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bi@@ og@@ as , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a farmer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , e@@ ternal myster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be cho@@ sen .
if you should ever have the chance to staf@@ f your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technologi@@ cal innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern spa@@ in , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; o@@ le , o@@ le , o@@ le , &quot; which you still hear in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces .
i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad e@@ col@@ o@@ gical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the vi@@ o@@ lin if i started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ lin pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decisi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly as@@ s@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the dies@@ el is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ arc@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intui@@ tive or not inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously us@@ able , including the i@@ pad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russi@@ a , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy agenda .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
that here is bio@@ curious , the ha@@ cker@@ space i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent@@ re for for molecular biology .
and if i now trans@@ fer this , if i let ori@@ ent take shape as an over@@ view , sele@@ ct as a sele@@ ction , in@@ form in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , trans@@ act means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the sh@@ opp@@ ing , etc . ,
i encoura@@ ge all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bon@@ d that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bon@@ d , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
the human ability to ada@@ pt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phr@@ ase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the in@@ her@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the pro@@ spe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est five-@@ year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
impli@@ c@@ it in this phr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circum@@ navi@@ gate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ecu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ hab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
and has nothing more to do with reality .
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from syn@@ thetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
just a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded its dra@@ per prize to fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques to encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- what fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old calls &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot;
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cro@@ o@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to engage during their ha@@ ma@@ ts@@ a initi@@ ation .
and they have there were two two tin@@ ker@@ ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and che@@ aper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so fre@@ ely available hard@@ ware and electr@@ on@@ ics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ri@@ pe for the market and are currently the the che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .
and m@@ s. par@@ ks used to come back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r who was the organi@@ zer of the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t -- amazing african american woman -- and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , repres@@ ented dr. king .
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ opp@@ ing from an infe@@ cted computer .
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
i had this en@@ counter recently where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virg@@ ini@@ a , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the landscape .
i once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with a young collea@@ gue , and it was only when i got to l@@ has@@ a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n apart to d@@ ust and as@@ hes , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the cultural revolution .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination re@@ duced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .
if one person said no , there was the ve@@ to principle , which was totally de@@ moral@@ is@@ ing , for ten years , i i had gra@@ ve dou@@ b@@ ts as to whether i was perhaps really wa@@ sting my great engineering degree on something ridi@@ cul@@ ous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wa@@ sted your money on your child .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we ex@@ ec@@ ute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the vic@@ tim is white than if the vic@@ tim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant is black and the vic@@ tim is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
this is a re@@ construction of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was done entirely compu@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally from images sc@@ ra@@ ped from fli@@ ck@@ r . you just type not@@ re d@@ ame into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ pus and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first sig@@ ns of pro@@ to-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communic@@ ations device -- i give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .
a couple of years ago , the las@@ ker prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ ast , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duced that cell to rever@@ t to a plu@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performance aspe@@ cts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in com@@ bat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs to the ch@@ ie@@ f of car@@ di@@ a@@ c surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and i wo@@ und up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russi@@ a , going through the pre-@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ ies is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ r@@ . acting as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double bas@@ s@@ ist whose promis@@ ing career was cut short by a tra@@ gic aff@@ li@@ ction with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 193@@ 0s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that make it easier to dete@@ ct those mistakes that humans inevi@@ t@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would de@@ dic@@ ate ourselves to the next top@@ ic of the future , which , in my opini@@ on , and in our opini@@ on , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this non@@ sense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about stor@@ age .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that meta@@ -@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a four@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and kee@@ ps repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequ@@ e@@ ster@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to mi@@ mic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metaph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
at one point , ja@@ vier said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ bas@@ sy -- give some to the u.s. em@@ bas@@ sy ; give some to the can@@ adi@@ an em@@ bas@@ sy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em@@ bas@@ sy gro@@ unds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
right , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my pres@@ entation by stat@@ ing that the characteri@@ stics and abilities that we ac@@ qui@@ red during the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be re@@ activ@@ ated with the help of the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technologi@@ cal , new products .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this u@@ tili@@ ty of our inter@@ actions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p moving around a flat des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras@@ p information physi@@ cally , ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
and now you see the sou@@ l as having something of a cloud like nature , an air@@ y nature , it &apos;s called anim@@ a in la@@ tin , being like a breath of air .
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether w@@ inning a second grade sp@@ elling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the girl sc@@ ou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , w@@ inning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my spor@@ ts vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstra@@ ct is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative indu@@ ces you to re@@ gre@@ t the decision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ cts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embra@@ ce gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , when defen@@ ding his prote@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael far@@ a@@ day -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ulti@@ mate , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;

certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , las@@ er surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , ti@@ tan@@ ium k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limit@@ s that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to cla@@ im their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global groups of their own choo@@ sing .

how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
just to know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ b@@ eit success@@ fully , many generations ago .
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the coffee family called psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al-@@ time news , videos , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transpor@@ tation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
wher@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to ada@@ pt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the pen@@ an -- a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@ duced to ser@@ vi@@ tude and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the si@@ lt that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese frei@@ gh@@ ters hang light in the hori@@ zon ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
