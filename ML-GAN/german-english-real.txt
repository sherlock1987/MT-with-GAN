thank you .
thank you .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s about that .
thank you .
positive .

thank you .
sustainable .
seriously .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
fine .
thank you .
this is true .
it su@@ cks .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s 1.@@ 5 million .
a whole lot .
thank you .
i &apos;m tom .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
we lose them .
oh , my god !
yeah . okay .
not yet .
thank you .
no hospital .
are they all ?
thank you .
we roll it down .
solar technology is ...
three out of 10 .
oh , my god .
we love entertain@@ ment .
we love innovation .
se@@ attle ...
what does that mean ?
this is not ...
home ?
we were poor .
what does that mean ?
that was incredible .
it &apos;s interesting .
after a week .
the only chance .
long , yeah .
as a language .
yeah , so .
but it goes .
didn &apos;t happen .
you need time .
that &apos;s continu@@ ing quick .
that &apos;s wrong .
great , right ?
yeah .
the sun wal@@ ks up .
that &apos;s the sing .
that &apos;s hard .
what &apos;s great ?
ta@@ -@@ da !
that was us .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know this .
sounds good ?
here it is .
it &apos;s terrible .
i don &apos;t know .
thank you . thank you .
stop twice .
ste@@ phen wat@@ ts .
you could see manhattan .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
so where do we go ?
here &apos;s the video .
you can go inside .
i was facing him .
they &apos;re all important .
so they knew everything .
it has sensor@@ s .
i have a question .
i was ama@@ zed .
that would be okay .
ban is blan@@ k .
it &apos;s essential .
but you know what ?
they don &apos;t sit around .
well , the one .
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
very different term .
so they do this .
how do you care about that .
there &apos;s no ordinary one .
so it &apos;s true .
this is very good .
there are a few more .
he op@@ ens the door .
why not live longer ?
do you see it .
it &apos;s not a country .
there &apos;s 1,000 , very good .
so she was back .
here &apos;s an example .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
it doesn &apos;t work .
i thought about it .
but i was working on .
or bom@@ bs .
and they did .
and i worked on .
what happened here ?
this is what we do today .
i don &apos;t think that .
why do we do it ?
okay . thank you .
and this is important .
what happened here ?
centers were built up .
i don &apos;t know .
oh , wait a minute .
so how does it work ?
so they meet al .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
there are two ways .
they re@@ gar@@ ded them again .
i &apos;m going into this .
you know what ?
thank you very much .
and it has to go back .
it &apos;s wonderful ?
this is our present .
yeah , millions seconds .
i want to tell you .
we can do it differently .
they have similar principles .
it &apos;s completely in@@ efficient .
what are media today ?
this is efficient .
all environmental debate .
not school admini@@ stration .
what do you say ?
why does this happen ?
we can do that .
do your job .
good work ! yes !
what do you want to do ?
thank you very much .
this was the result .
can we change it ?
this is all about .
this is the last .
yeah , that goes .
flying c@@ at .
so let &apos;s watch .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
that &apos;s it .
not tox@@ ic inside it .
these days are over .
this is a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
that was fascinating .
thank you .
we need energy .
that &apos;s great .
can i be honest ?
b@@ g : thank you .
they b@@ low . &quot;
it sounds familiar , what ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
not very often happening .
and i was artists .
pretty good , right ?
this is the system .
what a fish .
you can see it immediately .
there &apos;s nothing happening there .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
this is already true .
to slow , slowly .
robert gor@@ p@@ ta .
the farm is un@@ belie@@ vable .
not very sustainable .
let &apos;s name it .
that &apos;s me .
what did you do ?
these people make money .
it really enjo@@ yed him .
here you can see it now .
will it have my hei@@ ght ?
am i going to do the color ?
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , everybody together .
here you can see the city .
so what happened then ?
who are these rela@@ tives ?
his name is temp@@ te .
and they did it very , very fam@@ ously .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you can see the water coming .
oh , thank you .
it &apos;s an almost iden@@ tical structure .
confli@@ cts of creativity emer@@ ge creativity .
i think rather than that .
that sounds crazy , right ?
the game is by 2007 .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
thank you .
but it &apos;s even worse .
be a ment@@ or .
or is it perhaps possible ?
some did come and go .
maybe 10 times as many .
i wanted to keep you healthy .
i swe@@ ar it .
and it got even better .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
after just one journey .
my gut feeling again .
this is what the graph looks like .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
and then it became international .
h@@ h .
it &apos;s my grand@@ father .
what do i look at ?
okay , some more .
is it all about photograph@@ y ?
is it all about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
here &apos;s another example .
there &apos;s something else .
let me wra@@ p up .
there &apos;s an old study .
yeah . all right .
this is a great question .
j@@ k : both .
put the camera out .
this is the short cen@@ su@@ s .
this is a great question .
it st@@ ops you fresh .
is this your opini@@ on ?
first of all , nar@@ ro@@ ws .
my name is am@@ it .
i grew up in india .
just continu@@ ing a lot of fun .
and the answer to that is no .
i made one .
it sounds bad .
well , what does that mean ?
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
but this is not protection .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , yes ?
that &apos;s not going to do it .
does anyone see something particular ?
you need to understand it .
pe@@ e a chance .
you can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
they didn &apos;t have books .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
but where are we useful ?
in china , it was different .
but the wrong thing .
we &apos;re not producing yourself .
you &apos;re compar@@ ing compar@@ ison .
and i &apos;ve always had .
why not think about that ?
very expensive mo@@ ti@@ es .
here &apos;s another example .
they even hurt .
why should we do that ?
i &apos;m a writer .
this is what most people here .
how do we actually work people ?
don &apos;t be ha@@ un@@ ted .
that &apos;s fe@@ li@@ x .
... his own story .
you can see that there .
thank you for listening .
the work of the interpre@@ tation .
so what does that mean ?
people were mad .
the data came in .
we need to spread the message .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
what happens now ?
and i understand that .
why is this ?
who will make sure ?
we first have the population .
it &apos;s paul off@@ d .
i agree with them .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
yeah , here it is .
but it didn &apos;t .
so what do we need to do ?
he had had the experience .
what has to be done ?
that &apos;s exc@@ it@@ able .
it &apos;s against justice .
i mean the sou@@ l .
what is the sou@@ l ?
i can argue anything .
we were tw@@ ent@@ y people .
i wonder .
an enormous challenge challenge .
we also call it skep@@ tical .
but what do you eat ?
there is no food .
i don &apos;t like this question .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
do you see those guys ?
i actually did two er@@ r@@ ors .
and then it happened again .
crisis . death .
maybe that &apos;s true .
and a lot of people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
and so did it .
i felt really good .
he went up and down .
it would be conf@@ used .
he was always showing here .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , he didn &apos;t .
it was still fish .
we have three primary groups .
there are online crime .
priv@@ acy has to be there .
what can we do ?
you look like this .
we love technology and creativity .
we have lost .
i per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated kids .
it has billions of them .
but what do we do ?
and this op@@ ens up a map .
i will never forget .
i will never forget that .
i was destro@@ yed by the ground .
it &apos;s about something .
it would be un@@ le@@ mor@@ able .
the only country in the world .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
it &apos;s not the problem .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
we &apos;re constantly moving together .
i &apos;ll stop it .
so they feel good . &quot;
it works like this .
because here &apos;s a mas@@ ses here ?
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
so paul is a terror@@ ist .
nobody has said this before .
the data is all the time .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
but the defin@@ ing thing is ...
and the shape plays role .
everybody talks about happiness today .
here &apos;s a surprise .
you don &apos;t have the story changed .
very sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
how should our te@@ stim@@ ony look like ?
this has the largest impact .
so they saw something ma@@ gical .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
what lessons do we learned ?
so it &apos;s a huge challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
and finally , epi@@ ky means .
the same thing , just bigger .
you don &apos;t care about other things .
it was a huge success .
and then to realize it .
who is the most successful ?
so this is the good news .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
they want to be fe@@ eding the world ?
the data hadn &apos;t available available .
the whole building was made of water .
in the morning , before the game .
first of the time , second .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
they saw the great impact .
and then all of them went down .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
play is not al@@ ig@@ n .
you can get those cloud .
you can play with different types of games .
let me get ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed .
this is about five feet long .
that was the beginning of the journey .
they &apos;re going to become computers in the free .
&quot; he said .
how many people would choose creativity ?
how about fit@@ ness ?
this is the exciting thing .
so we can .
let &apos;s be honest -- who is normal ?
i wanted to get normal .
what would you most like ?
they create an epi@@ c story .
play is not just kids .
is this all about education ?
now how did that happen ?
these changes are coming .
and this was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
the creativity had to get out .
let &apos;s go to it . &quot;
i can &apos;t use it .
it should work .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
so now you &apos;re ha@@ cking ?
what &apos;s actually happened ?
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in context .
does anyone know what this is ?
they really loved it .
this is what happened for s@@ ant@@ a .
then i can trans@@ mit this .
you can &apos;t store energy .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we do .
and we are too many of them .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
so , not like de@@ to@@ x .
so let me re@@ mind you .
everyone needs a fish glass .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s all easy to have .
answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
but i felt worse .
they could do better .
right now , when it &apos;s the waste .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
okay , that really matters .
so , you know .
is that common@@ -@@ sense ?
so the question is : how ?
what is this ?
everybody &apos;s fall@@ ing away .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
and of course it &apos;s incredible talks .
i only loved two .
it &apos;s not really technical .
they say , why ?
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
and here &apos;s the theme .
and then they put up .
thank you for your attention .
and already you have a problem .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
it doesn &apos;t work very well .
i wanted to support them .
to one , great .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people living .
he showed up on the al@@ ga@@ e .
this is an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
we can &apos;t just do that .
you can train them .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
how did that feel ?
it will always be more like the same .
my wife told me .
do it curious ?
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
because i can say anything .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
it didn &apos;t have that sou@@ l .
this is such a science thing .
she did it for three years .
sometimes i go too much .
i talk a lot about these questions .
we all love baseball , right ?
the white lines represent the population .
let &apos;s talk about hydro@@ wars wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
that was gran@@ ted .
once the ju@@ dge saw me .
so i went to court .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s not our citizens .
today it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
i should probably not .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy energy of the sun .
do the kids do no longer .
i got a fear of technology .
and there are hundreds of them .
but they do the job .
and it starts with a doctor .
and is the cru@@ x .
i don &apos;t need to worry about it !
so we started a vi@@ vi@@ ty .
people still were happy .
it was my first sun@@ rise .
actually , he did fish .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
it divi@@ des your experiences with others .
so what is the next step ?
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it &apos;s a 25@@ 7 .
but there are two problems .
i started to feel better .
slowly , slowly , it took it .
she was back and dying .
the nur@@ se asked the nur@@ se .
my second mistake was worse .
i learned everything .
that made me really sad .
but it was very sad .
i see this b@@ ust sign .
what other br@@ ands do ?
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
they come from artificial artists .
that &apos;s not what i should say .
i &apos;m going to show you this now .
this is all the meta@@ dat@@ es .
this is one of the images .
the two were calling me .
and it took 18 months .
we were in an area .
tell me about the world .
le@@ ver technology .
this is ris@@ ky .
that would not have a problem at all .
the power plant can explo@@ de .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
and that worked very well .
and again , it showed him ja@@ zz .
and then something funny happened .
her mother was going on her way .
the story isn &apos;t over .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
and this doesn &apos;t tell a lot about us .
it da@@ w@@ ns these two people .
and that &apos;s not at all .
maybe even in mobile phones , perhaps even in mobile phones .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is an illusion .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to do .
no one have been a way .
this is from this place .
it &apos;s very simple .
what happened that day ?
well , let &apos;s do it .
okay , there are some .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
think of your own decisions .
one place is south korea .
and it was an amazing experience .
next , nuclear power .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so the dynam@@ ics became really changed .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live .
we have something that isn &apos;t ris@@ ing .
for energy , this is one .
now i see gre@@ g le@@ mond .
there &apos;s a billion people who are star@@ ving at you .
definitely we need a solution .
there &apos;s another reason .
architec@@ ts and engineers , lu@@ ck .
i was trying something interesting .
there &apos;s also a world record .
i stop , thank you very much .
and everybody in this room needs to be there .
and then we said , okay .
very simple , so that &apos;s going to come .
he &apos;s going to the right thoughts .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the project l@@ ac@@ ks .
it &apos;s bus@@ y to make sense of sound .
yeah , these are the data .
how far can you possibly do anything ?
and that brought me through this ...
do that for kids ? &quot;
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . it changes us .
in the assu@@ mption of maybe two percent .
i loved myself from this fish .
it f@@ loo@@ ds the chan@@ n@@ els .
and this can make a huge difference .
so he &apos;s perfectly in the middle .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
but what will happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
but that does not be the end .
so this crazy story could vote .
we &apos;ve been doing it since 199@@ 4 .
students are divi@@ ded by gra@@ des .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
we have a kind of counter@@ -@@ balance .
who does not want to be heal@@ t@@ ated ?
these are going to be un@@ con@@ tain@@ ed .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
and here they are .
and the obje@@ ctive of this is very simple .
i think the kni@@ fe in my hand .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
this is ide@@ ology , not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
so , look at what happens .
i &apos;m going back to my sle@@ ase .
the result of that was dis@@ orders .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
and this is a very simple question .
what is it called a story ?
so the cor@@ relation cor@@ respon@@ ds .
no , i mean really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
so the natural things are pres@@ ented .
the living im@@ migr@@ ants of the spirit .
these things are logi@@ cal cor@@ rec@@ tly .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
so , in the third hand , we &apos;ve for@@ gotten .
and this is really at the beginning .
i want to show you this .
anyway , to navi@@ gate .
the book and the image .
let &apos;s do a little inter@@ section .
already , for longer than those other two networks .
here he leaves the sun .
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes what recogni@@ zes .
does anyone know what three seconds ?
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
what does this mean for designers ?
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
was a pretty good project .
there &apos;s leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in kids .
we started this 15 years ago .
sun@@ light and co2 is a metho@@ d@@ fold .
we &apos;ve read about millions of times .
a has these advan@@ tages and risks .
and there are several reasons for this .
do you want je@@ ans with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
that &apos;s completely over@@ all .
great ! this machine is pretty no@@ is@@ y .
i think it makes you lau@@ gh .
these ri@@ vers can take a ride .
this is the memory of memory .
this is a picture remin@@ ded on something .
let &apos;s leave it away .
you can &apos;t have any teeth .
you can &apos;t do anything .
so the first step to interpretation .
you know what it is ?
because for me , it means memory .
he was already talking about six@@ ties .
and it &apos;s always not an interpretation .
it &apos;s like learning to learn .
and this sounds very different from the time .
and what does it figure out ?
the reasons it &apos;s writing it .
you &apos;ve already been talking ?
let me get something through the head .
no , no , no , no , that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s interested in fire@@ fire .
it mel@@ ted up .
it has to be the obje@@ ctive difference .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
asking questions , what is the right ?
in how we think about north .
zer@@ tate mis@@ sions , yes ?
so you can &apos;t solve it .
we can re@@ move our nutri@@ ents .
but we need that over@@ all .
but very effectively , it turns out , yes ?
for people over the ur@@ ine .
i started an institute .
we &apos;re in germany sustain@@ ability .
that &apos;s the mini@@ mal .
you can show me , i was there .
if you come to this , yeah ?
we can rein@@ vent anything again .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
i &apos;ve learned this from my grandmother .
this is perhaps going to be trans@@ fer@@ red .
it can know where we are .
i talked a lot about magic .
this is the ap@@ the@@ a .
i tried to understand them .
my brother star@@ ed at me .
all of these generations need a few milli@@ seconds seconds .
we &apos;ve run a lot of things already .
this is a very sensitive question .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
now we &apos;re going to do it with air@@ planes .
i started with my usual talk .
oh , my time is already over ?
they didn &apos;t give up government .
who would ever be one wish ?
but it requires a lot of planning .
and this morning i go on .
i think there are ways .
it &apos;s continu@@ ing rapi@@ dly .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
we don &apos;t have the ap@@ p .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
her dad just died after her birth .
b@@ j@@ an@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
they were gene@@ tically engine@@ ered .
it won &apos;t be docum@@ ented .
and nobody seems to break up .
i &apos;m the defin@@ ing doctor .
and his response was &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i don &apos;t have anything to hi@@ de . &quot;
priv@@ acy is not debat@@ t@@ led .
le@@ go made it all possible .
it &apos;s all about changing industri@@ es .
for a year , we had no en@@ ding .
because we &apos;re living on a water planet .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
but perhaps this is not the case .
we actually re@@ defined poverty .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
baseball is full of great statistics .
the other had strong break@@ through .
they gave their blood pressure up .
her family repli@@ ed .
why did i go into medicine ?
it would have been too easy .
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i went to prison -- hard .
we need to think about what mar@@ ks .
that did not make sense in my eyes .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
okay , you really want to know ?
that sounds fre@@ est@@ y .
that was more to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ an .
and i had to go out of the city .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what would you describe ?
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
i really like to make beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
you can do that all the time .
and this video is real time .
i describe that the ro@@ ot tiger .
just be , who you are .
the game begins -- sil@@ ence .
i like things that are different .
but the truth is far away .
we &apos;ve won a couple of pri@@ ces .
it can only use his eyes .
what are you going to do about it ? &quot;
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
mm@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
will it be less than 20 dollars ?
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
we need to grow complexity slowly .
they even bring financial services with them .
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil .
here &apos;s your mar@@ ker repor@@ ting .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
who do you actually care about ?
so we measu@@ red its movement .
oh my god . oh my god .
who could seem to anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te this ?
all the adults were aware of the risks .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
slightly lower in me .
thank you , but the best thing is .
but then you really want to go deep down .
it &apos;s extremely good .
the film hasn &apos;t been imple@@ mented .
they want to go into the museum ?
thank you very much .
you see a funny thing here .
this is a picture of the object .
it seems very popular .
it &apos;s got to experience the experience .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
st@@ ones are f@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
what exer@@ cis@@ es me ?
what do you do about the waste ?
there &apos;s also under@@ lying these sources .
that sol@@ ves the fu@@ r problem .
it should con@@ tain the two elements .
there are lots of great books on this subject .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
it &apos;s still continu@@ ing .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
that &apos;s just a in@@ sur@@ ance method .
and l@@ ing@@ bor@@ g is thinking .
you can predict the future . why is this happening ?
they run the process , they understand him .
so this is a tough nose .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
sil@@ ence ? i was completely conf@@ used .
&quot; the best part of the industry . &quot;
the che@@ f had it co@@ ok .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally it was a disaster .
you &apos;ve got literally put up the le@@ ver .
i &apos;m an exper@@ te on relationships . &quot;
does anyone know what this is ?
there &apos;s no half or a half ? &quot;
he sho@@ ot@@ ed his head , no .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
it was truly profound .
so what can we do from all this ?
there was never a time before this .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next apri@@ l .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
what do you think happens next ?
that &apos;s what we get a absolutely flat line .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
and there &apos;s h@@ unt employees .
so the first exciting prime prime .
this is the truth . i believe .
thank you . i have a question for you .
he had 20 minutes of gl@@ ory music .
i &apos;ll tell you the insi@@ ghts .
but it &apos;s not just words .
wi@@ dri@@ tion@@ ality is just to our lives .
we can give ourselves a little bit of ourselves .
it &apos;s a redu@@ ction in the image .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
we &apos;ve also got a very accu@@ rate data .
we don &apos;t want companies to have see@@ ds .
and why ? developing food food .
we &apos;re going to talk about it differently .
this guy in the middle not so much .
we have now mas@@ s@@ ers in this country now .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
they &apos;ve got them . they &apos;ve always got them .
it &apos;s not even the truth to get rid of them .
everyone would like to make us happ@@ ier .
because we don &apos;t want to go around ?
so he &apos;s here . right .
so the si@@ ter@@ ing is a role .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
i hope you exc@@ use me .
we &apos;re running out of initi@@ ation ritu@@ als .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
but i &apos;ll get to you again .
but we start to see change .
this is one part of you .
it &apos;s about a new care of america .
we need to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
that sounds basically an unusual case .
it just wasn &apos;t , you know ?
and this picture was recor@@ ded by at@@ las .
no , no , no , no , no .
i want to tell you a little bit about this for a minute .
maybe again , a look behind it .
so from the modern era in computer society .
to say , what is information ?
this is a an@@ nu@@ al di@@ ving river .
d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog , right .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t care anything other than discover .
this is my super@@ market . no big deal .
they dri@@ ll each other .
this level of intuition is very important .
they &apos;re the hot countries of somebody .
15@@ 6 nations send back to the television chan@@ nel .
now let &apos;s get something else .
and then , again , look at it .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
in other areas , the world of communication .
these are mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re all starting questions .
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we have unique elements here .
you look at the back@@ gro@@ unds .
language is expression of the human spirit .
the mechan@@ ism comes out of the lies .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
so basically , trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
this is such a com@@ intui@@ tive part .
his personal impres@@ sions of the ero@@ tic .
most of all , when he died .
tell them what they find .
so there are two cir@@ cles of cir@@ cles .
in two hours , they make it all over the place .
a particularly beautiful story , as i say .
and then he can run away .
because now you can use a three-@@ sentence .
do it even from school .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sent@@ ences .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been lab@@ el@@ ed .
you make it ki@@ te .
sh@@ h the environment , go less waste .
this is just a little less fall@@ ing .
it has to be first working as a present .
so , what takes five milli@@ seconds ?
this is another paradig@@ m shift .
i try this through an example .
and the curi@@ osity of curi@@ osity don &apos;t care .
i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog .
but with the real design , there we go .
so , you can &apos;t have men a pi@@ g .
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
we can support them to be good .
the by@@ product is clean water .
we can support them to be good .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
this country is unlike 40 years ago .
so it &apos;s got a rec@@ ru@@ pt re@@ plac@@ ement .
they were inspired by us .
it can know how to think about it .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic repres@@ entation .
next step happened within these communities .
my cou@@ sin everywhere dri@@ f@@ ted around .
something very strange here .
many of my students are very young .
i per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated people in the death cells .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
it will touch them deeply .
gui@@ de maybe some mu@@ tations .
i said , &quot; i will listen . &quot;
we were working late late the night .
i believed everybody could do this .
he died , broken by the history .
i never met him personally .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l space .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let you go . &quot;
boston didn &apos;t have a call center .
the water@@ front is from another place .
it may be , until it &apos;s lo@@ aded .
this is a mo@@ dest little ap@@ p .
so scot@@ t get this fru@@ it .
do you want to get there and listen ? &quot;
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of this .
she wasn &apos;t dro@@ w@@ ned .
you lose fewer and fewer animals .
what you need is a new medical culture .
i &apos;m a man . i make er@@ r@@ ors .
it was a grou@@ ky .
they tend to grow up to five centi@@ meters .
this is the system that we live in .
the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
alone , sh@@ ine and no support .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
but today , we &apos;re far beyond that .
you ta@@ p your internet connection .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
even cat@@ s look at this video .
&quot; a p@@ ale do@@ t . &quot;
so this was a problem for super@@ computers .
you should also ask them what wi@@ sh@@ es .
that i wrote this crazy thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
i &apos;m going to get ti@@ red , as we all .
what are those three billion people going to bring ?
but i was interested in these questions .
we expect some remarkable decades .
maybe i did it with good reasons .
the emergen@@ cy room was all moved .
and that was what i felt .
he was moving back to sil@@ ence .
the main man win@@ ds me .
and that was the break@@ off .
normal people are not available to us . &quot;
the roof was also covered in water .
here you can see how the building works .
here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
as artists , i &apos;m really interested in the associ@@ ation .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine sta@@ tic .
mt is fully paraly@@ zed .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won &apos;t ga@@ ther the end .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can be made .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
it comes out of all of your own po@@ ckets .
do it -- you all here .
so this is the reason for this project .
two minutes later , three things happened simul@@ tane@@ ously .
they had a concept of blue blood .
states of those kinds of lives don &apos;t exist .
but the game is a form@@ -@@ changing .
we &apos;ll come back to those people later .
we don &apos;t know why this happens .
in many cases these people are completely healthy .
that &apos;s not the rou@@ te .
and women argu@@ ing that .
let &apos;s start with this .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
it &apos;s called &quot; lea@@ f with me . &quot;
this is a painting of a circle of a circle .
look at what she does .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
now , who is willing for this journey .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct of the story .
you &apos;ve appl@@ au@@ d all the appl@@ ause .
i have here on my laptop . &quot;
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tively .
and i want to read to you the pres@@ ence .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate directly into the artists .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ers .
i didn &apos;t really want to do any vi@@ ral video .
he just wanted to share one bo@@ w .
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of conser@@ va@@ tions .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
there &apos;s j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my .
so ... does it mean not as optimi@@ stic .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
at a certain obje@@ ctive of course .
by the way , that &apos;s just the oper@@ ator .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
the goal of the film is transpar@@ ency .
it &apos;s swi@@ t@@ ched down the engine .
no , that was what i thought was .
tell me a little bit about this piece .
there &apos;s a whole dis@@ h whi@@ st@@ p of food .
we &apos;re talking about cool , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
they have brought their pictures , yes ?
so li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its is open .
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all up .
you can immer@@ se in a particular year .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
how is the fu@@ r production ? &quot;
tomorrow , you fly 2@@ 40 miles to farm .
and every night , you fly 2@@ 40 miles back .
let &apos;s look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
it &apos;s kind of sh@@ et@@ ing us in a sense .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
you can jump directly into one particular out@@ put .
i &apos;m going to vote the issue of government .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ine in information . &quot;
i was totally excited about , you know .
i didn &apos;t meet myself .
it was still more deli@@ very .
they live with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
and yes , i &apos;m going again .
and then it looks like this .
pic@@ as@@ so says , wait .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
i raised it in a particularly way .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and accu@@ rate .
say , there &apos;s no predic@@ t@@ ers .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
&quot; sustainable proteins &quot; he said .
it was easy to say , okay .
this has nobody in the world .
so naturally , it off@@ ers smar@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ans .
so smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
and in time , you can respond to another .
so that really ble@@ w my mind .
can you also play me in blue ?
we &apos;re very technologi@@ cal fo@@ ods .
you know that science is not a company .
and they &apos;re not only going to be dead at mas@@ per@@ y .
why do we do it ? why do we do it ?
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we get rid of what didn &apos;t work .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
they were just like the people in this room .
we have them comp@@ ell@@ ed . pop p@@ ink .
sh@@ ame . sh@@ ame .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o@@ on .
in the back , somebody who has no childhood had a childhood .
what ? that made me ski@@ p .
i &apos;m really sorry . make it crazy ?
what happened is that we could do that .
do you remember the wind ?
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this sphere .
we need to use it for more research sp@@ ills .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
the internet and its service is a mira@@ cle .
the last three of the five , i put together .
and there &apos;s a ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship problem .
this has to go down to zero , zero .
my parents are 80 on the thro@@ ws .
you &apos;re hop@@ ing that we don &apos;t need it .
they don &apos;t invest time fighting .
what do you think about these design students ?
do we have a machine here .
my grand@@ parents kept up to 70 .
now the instru@@ ments have moved .
you only hear them and start talking .
so each conc@@ ert is another conc@@ ert .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
that &apos;s going to be roll@@ ed on the land .
this is the machine below gene .
and they had to re@@ move what we did .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
seriously -- the under@@ gang is going to be lab@@ el@@ ed .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this is the primary mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else .
and this is great , because we need this .
and if you don &apos;t , tan@@ ks still have your dance .
it &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed in red .
so , the hydro@@ gen has bigger .
it becomes a challenge for 9 .
i start with some simple examples .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
well , this carto@@ on does some say .
that &apos;s the laun@@ ch do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
so that &apos;s how super@@ market is .
we don &apos;t de@@ f@@ end identity , we make them .
but here &apos;s what you should think .
here &apos;s a few on the ham@@ p@@ to@@ ks .
now i &apos;m putting a b@@ ass up there .
we have only sig@@ ned sig@@ ned .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
your problem is that you have too little .
they care about that .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask more questions .
they laugh@@ ed more than her here .
so , for example , america is new .
and the problem is not the technology .
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficiency .
there &apos;s every foot@@ print there .
sh@@ h the environment , consu@@ l@@ less energy .
and all of this is pac@@ ka@@ ged or content .
that &apos;s going to happen in china in a second .
because that &apos;s kind of clear , right ?
or take a li@@ pp@@ er .
and there &apos;s a central point .
i &apos;ve e@@ aten all the time already .
so not saving , you know , avoid avo@@ i@@ dance .
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
no , we lay out what &apos;s inside it .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
all of this is com@@ pati@@ ble of it .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is a lot of critical .
so , help me help me a little bit .
and the last two are still here today .
definitely , that you do it .
i &apos;m happy to me that i am .
so , that was my prime motivation .
and the list you can go on .
what are they actually arch@@ a@@ mic models now ?
now , if you want to think a little bit more about it .
now i &apos;m going to do something more about this .
this is called the o@@ si@@ t-@@ model model .
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society is the language of language .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
now you see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog .
that &apos;s actually how the nor@@ m happens .
let me show you a little bit about .
there had to be another piece of puzz@@ le .
life had not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true .
nobody needs to give their ideas green light .
my grandmother never ignor@@ ed me his life .
but so many people were going to help us over the years .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my fourth technology : requi@@ red to complexity .
the third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
my mother decided a few minutes after this .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but it has an un@@ expected man@@ ability .
and yet , there is a reali@@ stic level .
is it all about the details or colors ?
eng@@ ines -- four ways .
after that , it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of different images .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
that &apos;s the point . thank you .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the fore@@ front .
you come up to two ways -- very simple .
you &apos;re going around and am@@ used .
you can zo@@ om in and zo@@ om in .
but the best thing is , in a second .
and here &apos;s how every piece of course is plan@@ ned .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be something that is completely intui@@ tive .
i mean nobody has ever seen one partic@@ le .
the rest of the time is del@@ oc@@ alized .
it fe@@ e@@ ds a thousand square miles .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
let me show you a simple simple example .
the first is a classi@@ c , apple .
then i ask myself : how could that happen ?
he came up to me and embra@@ ced me .
but we seem to seem to be satis@@ fied with it .
there are some high-@@ tech develop@@ ments .
we create new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we want to do something against the death pen@@ al@@ ty company .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i said , &quot; okay , om@@ a . &quot;
first of all , i thought this was a game .
then he pi@@ cked me into o@@ hr .
and i have to say , there was force .
well , i came to the court room .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something to do .
what would you tell somebody who belie@@ ves ?
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
it &apos;s like i want to be .
that is that our contribu@@ tion to the system is .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
next week , this is coming up on the market .
we &apos;ve been asking them , and nobody knew it .
i work in the solar engineering industry .
now there &apos;s a lot of people who gave government government .
scot@@ t adap@@ ted to human .
it has a butt@@ on .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
all the people who were so , starting to divi@@ de .
and try and do this again with another generation .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i started to illu@@ strate books at 16 .
the story@@ telling has always taken more sense .
it hasn &apos;t come out in any other countries .
now i would take the need@@ le out .
ee@@ e@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
so they &apos;re going to go on ; they get the shoes .
we &apos;ve been here for about 1@@ 15@@ 0,000 years .
i tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to re@@ cover the health after a disease .
it &apos;s not the test of survival and success .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
come on with me . thank you .
teachers didn &apos;t know anything that changed .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their famili@@ ar@@ ity .
so two pa@@ irs , each one is a baby .
now think of it for a second .
in many different forms of time , in many different forms .
they &apos;re in the back part of the body .
raise your hands . let me see .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
but it &apos;s definitely not an op@@ tic situation .
people were dying . people f@@ ought .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
thank you for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
it was almost the imagination of the imagination .
this is a problem that many players have .
i get this feedback in the real world .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
and of course , it &apos;s about click .
what we want to do is create the future .
this is not a lot of trouble .
and i say that &apos;s good .
maybe we can see what &apos;s going to look like .
it was summer and i had sh@@ ops .
so we have this horri@@ ble idea .
there &apos;s a lot of lu@@ ck co@@ vers .
you just need to pass it as far as you can .
what do you think the answer ?
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
so that made sense together , it adap@@ ted together .
so again , that adap@@ ted really well .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and what i &apos;m talking about is really important .
think of an airplane as well .
it was something that we knew .
i didn &apos;t want to do something about the film .
actually , that was not the mistake at all .
there &apos;s a positive effect .
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ based conc@@ ern .
they &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
i never want to move more into life .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum type .
but reality is always un@@ predic@@ table .
i want to show you something very first .
don@@ th@@ day : self-@@ trust is the key .
and i &apos;m going to be able to sum@@ mar@@ ize it for you .
it came out and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
second two days . end of normal play .
mon@@ day : color is something more powerful .
and we need a lot to do about this device .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
this is something that is built in the city .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side you see a little boat .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so they walk along their fing@@ ers .
so i spoke a few months later .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
and this argu@@ ments don &apos;t make sense .
i thought i could integra@@ te integr@@ ated .
it can give you a order of changes .
the question is , why people accept it .
it &apos;s suppor@@ ting other people &apos;s mistakes .
what do you do ?
the three words l@@ oud : do you remember ?
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and safety .
let me show you how they work .
you can &apos;t put them wrong .
we &apos;re still thinking , you &apos;re origin@@ ally .
and we increase our expec@@ tations continu@@ ing continu@@ ing continu@@ ing continu@@ ing continu@@ ing .
it was a lot of us , and i put in eg@@ gs .
it &apos;s a game that is called a message .
it &apos;s the average achie@@ ver of your sleep .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon rates .
we think of energy sc@@ or@@ city .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
notice two things in this cur@@ ve .
and this is really important in medical research .
and i would go back to work .
you know how you call a 4@@ 2,000 names ?
i put them up and made me into the treatment .
i remember thinking about it yesterday .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
probably one of those fig@@ ures has to come from zero to zero .
in each of these five areas , we need to be at least 100 people .
why do i do it ? what does it take ? &quot;
these blocks don &apos;t give us money .
there &apos;s a connection , another respect .
i think the first point is the curi@@ osity of curi@@ osity .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and so i came up with a slightly more unusual decision .
and this i found a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement .
the engine is the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the problem here is , here is something like aids .
mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be up .
so this was a highly strange experience .
now they figured out the benefit of the prototyp@@ ing .
i had a relationship with this beauty of multiple months .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
we &apos;ve already had tw@@ ent@@ y percent in germany .
those were the very first calcu@@ lations of six years ago .
is it great , then we have a business model .
there &apos;s also a whole lot of studies now .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music is an em@@ bo@@ und health .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
so basically , my two passi@@ ons .
you &apos;ve got the flow of the earth back .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos e@@ aten the gar@@ sh@@ es .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
you &apos;re doing something that is actually a bit differently .
i thought , let &apos;s get the po@@ em@@ s in the field .
because this person actually car@@ ries about hard .
and they say , what happens to these moments ?
there seems to be an in@@ dul@@ gen@@ cy to give .
probably many of you here in the room have this trick .
there &apos;s a role to play that too .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
the people in the ed@@ ges are now coming in .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
well , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
this is not about how happy a person is alive .
that &apos;s a little bit of an epi@@ mor@@ an vic@@ tim .
you expect an addi@@ tional billion of them in the next decade .
definitely . that &apos;s what i want to do .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t say about reality .
so we &apos;re going away , and where are we going to go ?
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
but you know what they don &apos;t care about right ?
well , i understand that . this is what i do .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
do you have all their vi@@ tam@@ ine ?
think about it . this is an amazing fact .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality pat@@ ents .
there were no can@@ tal@@ -@@ mel@@ ting mel@@ ting .
we &apos;ve made it in the last 1@@ 1,000 thousand years .
and some of it works , and it doesn &apos;t work .
we don &apos;t care that companies have pat@@ ented pat@@ s .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s raise it .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we can continue those things in different examples .
now he &apos;s running a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
i can make the conclu@@ sion on them .
in fact , coal is not mess@@ y .
and they feel as much their mov@@ ements and tenden@@ cy .
here &apos;s another couple of people who are testing it .
so , for example , they were building blocks .
we wanted to develop a lesson for learning learning .
this is a completely un@@ comfortable development patterns .
if your job is dan@@ cing , dan@@ cing .
so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
this should actually not be a jo@@ ke at all , but .
well , what do we do ?
it &apos;s the reality of the reality , and it &apos;s not computers .
or they didn &apos;t have a camera to@@ graph graph .
they seem to have seen it in the news .
and in this head , the memory was playing .
and the world in which we saw looked like this .
everyone in my manhattan is gone .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ ception here .
if you want to build it hyper@@ links between images .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re so often inv@@ enting ourselves as we want to do .
from the age age to the age age , the age age .
i &apos;ve probably got another 40 years in me .
i wear je@@ ans , almost all the time .
but actually don &apos;t get a bad thing to do .
that &apos;s a little bit of a du@@ sty of six seconds .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
so we com@@ mit about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
the only thing that had happened was your head .
there are ones that are much more spa@@ tial .
a phr@@ ase with his own breath .
but maybe you can also vote them together .
it &apos;s sort of a behavior operating inside print .
have a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of this .
and i said , in my you@@ th , i said , expec@@ tations .
because the notes are the only bon@@ d directly to him .
interpretation is har@@ dly spoke in the early class .
everywhere these wind r@@ ings , almost close .
technical cycle gives rise to the same .
why don &apos;t i have to do this small car ?
he &apos;s not really dec@@ ei@@ ving them and not yourself .
because without those li@@ ve@@ li@@ ds can &apos;t live .
so , we can &apos;t do those things .
do that , and then you get the phr@@ ase .
in the countries where people get to money .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the first question is , are we really too pl@@ enti@@ ful ?
that means that we need to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
this is a game i &apos;ve got to say .
we &apos;ve figured that weather global .
what &apos;s actually going to look like ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
what rema@@ ins us is the first thing to do .
but we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
and we see that it goes through .
but the phosp@@ hor@@ us is not able to replace .
if you fall in somebody , effici@@ ently ?
i say , thank you very much , right ?
it &apos;s not all about com@@ pres@@ der@@ it@@ able .
that &apos;s where we have 1.@@ 5 billion players .
... could you just show the slide for a second .
the transition happens . we can feel all those things .
but what happened to &quot; the &quot; paper &quot; is different .
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ or .
good night , south . &quot;
and we use this word with such a con@@ temp@@ t .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
this is the call center for service and information .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
so , every drink has been a little different .
the truth of dna was an interesting step .
again , stor@@ age those measu@@ re@@ ments , li@@ f@@ ted the rest .
tell me , &quot; please remember this process . &quot;
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
and it worked . appl@@ ause of scot@@ t .
and i get a character in the book .
so i think the bas@@ ics are very simple .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
i was not familiar with the e@@ ti@@ cket .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
i met the decision to attra@@ ct the united states .
if i say reality , i mean photo@@ reality .
the child in me is really excited about such op@@ tions .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city boston .
the under@@ water part is made from a stein@@ a .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
we have all the security systems in our cars .
and we want to put this in a global level .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
now we &apos;re going to do it with dri@@ ll be@@ ars and machines .
no apple has ever blo@@ cked up again .
and this was not a very difficult diagno@@ sis .
maybe i don &apos;t want to be the need for the need .
we have access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology .
we have the passion of a den@@ ser inno@@ v@@ ators .
well , really well , maybe an all@@ -@@ star star .
i was a comp@@ ul@@ sive graduate student .
and let &apos;s go back to my high doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this also in mobile phones .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
she was har@@ dly brea@@ thing and was blue .
this is the kind of teaching cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ er sh@@ ame .
at one point i thought he had wi@@ ken@@ ed ro@@ cks .
all of this is mistake er@@ ror .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
there &apos;s a program some of you already know .
in 2010 , it has been looked at 23 million times .
sil@@ ence is o@@ via .
the question question is an interesting question .
you can say things that have influence throughout the world .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she had the last word in every family .
i remember thinking about it yesterday .
capacity , not de@@ bt , the result .
it also shows up on the other side of the book .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
i seem to care about both of them .
and i said , &quot; yeah , really like . &quot;
and i went out and listen@@ i@@ ed .
we want to fix the number of cro@@ ples .
we want to create mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ations .
my mother was dre@@ am@@ ed by the cros@@ sed dreams of the boat .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to do .
and this is all about a big question ...
here are the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
so you can get the whole movement .
you don &apos;t talk about god and nature god .
we see the same in the dis@@ ab@@ led rights movement .
but how do you do it in practice ?
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ ting is totally over@@ lo@@ aded .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
and it &apos;s not only related to gender .
they &apos;re both life@@ -@@ living , both of them .
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
this is something that we call our stop sh@@ it .
i didn &apos;t need to talk to the board .
i learned that in a moment everything is changed .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
we see that in all sorts of different ways of human life .
i want to tell you how we found that .
do you want to be attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
how would it be to live longer in the good health ?
i think , in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ eight players were playing the game eight weeks .
you see , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking .
and then it was after the three months .
these results were done by several weeks of work .
but are we going to do the best of our play ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
how could it be that we do this ?
i said , am@@ anda does our eleph@@ ant .
the dog ! i was lost .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
and this is the planning behind st@@ x@@ net .
i first agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
another favorite photograph of me , star night .
and that was an experience in del@@ hi for me .
how did that do ? what succe@@ e@@ ded ?
that &apos;s just -- no press , no television , no television .
and finally , should we wel@@ come transpar@@ ency wel@@ come .
em@@ em@@ c pres@@ ented her transpar@@ ency wel@@ come .
here we were , and this is painting .
or are they more like a down@@ brea@@ thing stick ?
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things about them .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
because it doesn &apos;t mean money .
and this is what these brand did .
i &apos;ll give you an example of what i mean .
they absolutely didn &apos;t care about the project .
so how are we going to see field in the film ?
because otherwise , if that would be even bigger .
you know how many people look at these ted@@ talks ?
you know , i had the idea for a film .
it was &quot; in per@@ ni@@ ty forever , forever . &quot;
and the answer is most likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s nat@@ ance and it &apos;s just nat@@ ance .
a little bit more about you , which you are .
i want to help you cal@@ m yourself .
all right , what is the brand brand ?
so i think this is my brand .
these are the people who form my world@@ view .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
you know that he was in 18@@ 35 here .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
if you use it , this is what happens .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of the animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a great loss of loss .
they &apos;re going to be sel@@ fish because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters is over here .
this is not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is a project project , how do we get to the target ?
you have to be willing to take risks like that .
so , a climate change will be terrible for them .
and the energy is very important for them to do .
the second factor is the services that we use .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural light bul@@ bs .
it changed my way of making films , completely .
this journey of discovery i learned a lot of things .
many people talk about an 8@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction in 20@@ 50 .
where is the world &apos;s greatest interest , which is really going to happen ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
in nuclear sector there are other innovation companies .
those who are argu@@ ing argu@@ ments are very little .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t tell yourself yourself .
because they have special skills of process@@ ing .
look at your bel@@ ly , p@@ ink .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so i &apos;ve taken a lot of fish in my life .
so you could feel it .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ come the destruction .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
we went back to the re@@ ck@@ ers of ti@@ tan@@ ic back .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can sub@@ stit@@ ute into a decade .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
as a child , i was always dre@@ aming books and so forth .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i was really obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep sea .
one is the ulti@@ mate thing i &apos;ve seen .
so , if sound says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
as a result , we do stron@@ ger social relationships on them .
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a national scientist scientist .
i mean , i r@@ ar@@ ely saw flat lines .
currently we spend three billion hours per week on online games .
this is one of the classi@@ c expres@@ ses playing games .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
this const@@ ant feedback is not in the true world .
that &apos;s not true at all .
the largest difference between them is time for us .
and those were the first of the people &apos;s first developed devices .
it was an extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
they divi@@ ded the queen into two hal@@ ds .
so i say , let &apos;s start with the world changing games !
ant@@ ac@@ y : healthy , strong , powerful .
the living self has no voice in this ele@@ ction .
the first two sent@@ ences , which are logi@@ cal cor@@ rect .
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i &apos;m going to run it for you and explain it .
we didn &apos;t have any kinder@@ garten at this country yesterday .
we &apos;re going into the arms of plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ industry .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
there &apos;s something that is a half billion people eat .
and i took it for a while to find out .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
i &apos;m just going to do the kni@@ fe just like this .
i take this hand away , and here is the kni@@ fe .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn this around .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
and this is bi@@ om@@ i@@ zing the message .
we dance into the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t tell about what &apos;s going on .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
and ol@@ ol@@ ene ! for you all , all of this .
everybody knew , your geni@@ us was a little bit of a h@@ ine .
go to par@@ ag@@ ish leon@@ ard co@@ hen .
his whole work@@ process has changed after that .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i &apos;m going to continue , because this is my job .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
we re@@ constru@@ cted them , re@@ pair them .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and s@@ hr@@ ink in summer .
but the volu@@ mes are much bigger than ever before .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are mat@@ ching each other .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to talk to all of you !
and the world in which we see now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
every great image is the beginning of a sho@@ ot .
but these are all the streets in the u.s. a .
many of them are covered in faces , etc .
they get a model of the entire earth coming out of the entire earth .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i said , &quot; it first has started . &quot;
now we &apos;re foc@@ using on fu@@ els of vi@@ fu@@ r generation .
paraly@@ sis is a string of choices .
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold glass glass . &quot;
our steps in digital life were exponenti@@ al .
you may have heard that we have made water@@ mar@@ ks .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the car comm@@ and .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ man man@@ ure .
the grand@@ father of this old man has exp@@ and@@ ed .
i can &apos;t play that way as in tw@@ ent@@ y years .
or b , because they don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
no , throw away , yes ?
it &apos;s a form of re@@ fu@@ behavior , right ?
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
in reality , the notes are very v@@ age and un@@ accu@@ rate .
i will never play more like this at this point .
that means that ants wei@@ gh much more than us .
that &apos;s why you know , how wei@@ gh .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen when a music is played .
and at all , you work a lot less than me .
because artists have a dist@@ ur@@ ded relationship to the lying .
this is the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
there &apos;s no out@@ -@@ of-@@ date problem of trees .
this is the most difficult part of my talk .
a se@@ me@@ ster to the subject of the issue user interface .
every society is em@@ powered by a primary medium .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change that has been given .
another example is the so-@@ called virtual reality .
these are rooms that are smart for people to respond to a human .
and that &apos;s what we like to do now .
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ ve what &apos;s in it .
and the third thing is that it actually explains itself .
and less us@@ able or user &apos;s friend@@ ly , it &apos;s .
so how do we look at that when we look up there ?
there &apos;s some more of my glas@@ ses there .
that &apos;s also coming back .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
how can i do something about this ?
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this talk .
politics doesn &apos;t work ; the government is changing change .
this is great . this is the digital part here .
the next step was to find the app@@ s for it .
and we created an i@@ pa@@ d@@ d ap@@ p .
so he became the citizens to re@@ cover them .
and there are projects like this at any level of government .
and i see the same process in com@@ bine photographs .
but that was not the end of the predat@@ or .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
so the occu@@ pa@@ tion movement has done it .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
cell cells started to re@@ hi@@ bit information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
we know one where all the gas is available .
so in other words , i &apos;m going to say first what i want to do .
&quot; not &quot; er@@ ror as un@@ true . &quot;
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
but what about this day , this particular fri@@ day ?
it &apos;s also urban designers and construction farmer , very interested in .
this is an idea that is really wor@@ thy of spre@@ ading .
i want to talk about the problem about some of the problems and some of the solutions .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ g@@ ots .
it &apos;s kind of embar@@ ras@@ sing and strange programs .
this year was almost 200 million times over this year .
lo@@ ves and spon@@ sor@@ s were cho@@ sen .
this year became almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le pieces .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
he described one of them as a very common .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
it &apos;s a totally bl@@ en@@ ding of er@@ ror .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things always the same .
they want to tell their stories . they share their stories .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
in both cases , oper@@ ated , and it would be fine .
now he &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
it &apos;s been developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
we &apos;re changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
that &apos;s actually what we &apos;re going to do now .
in the future , most of the crime will play .
now , how do people die in a row of such ha@@ cks ?
both cases of me were asking me .
i don &apos;t see why this should not be .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
we were just wander@@ ing around as well as else .
i think that &apos;s true for people on the planet .
here he says , &quot; do your finger on each light . &quot;
at one point , the screen has filled with leaves .
the only problem was that they had 10 kids .
i said , &quot; promis@@ es , om@@ a . &quot;
but i really think that after us something else .
so these women come and sat themselves together .
thir@@ ty years ago , that sounds ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
child mortality is a tent@@ h redu@@ ction .
so growth itself is acceler@@ ating .
the faces faces were very seriously and attention .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you do@@ ors ?
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the middle .
zi@@ z@@ zi@@ e , in a moment of head .
well , we &apos;ve pres@@ ented the ma@@ yo@@ r hole .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you can almost look a lot like that for less than 50 dollars .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
in fr@@ ance , in it@@ al@@ y does a regular .
they were moving into a conser@@ vation concept .
now we know all about where we get from this .
it &apos;s a girl . she is raised as girls .
we called it the digital water rele@@ ase .
you can move inside and get different kinds of experiences .
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
think of a so@@ und@@ less plane .
how do you ju@@ dge people because of their character ?
i said , &quot; please fly flying into the air . &quot;
so in many different var@@ ie@@ ties , there &apos;s a lot of vari@@ ations coming up .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue to continue .
he &apos;s steel every five hop@@ es of my consciousness .
how would you be going to be better than you currently ?
how many would you choose to have a good gest@@ ure ?
is it for others ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
and in the world , everything has a sense of me .
so think about two other little changes .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
if you have something , it &apos;s now .
and no , it &apos;s not a man or san francisco .
now , chimpanze@@ es are familiar with their ag@@ gressi@@ ve st@@ ages .
play is ti@@ ck@@ le that teach@@ es us .
he says , &quot; pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed to the pr@@ ou@@ f . &quot;
they &apos;re bringing them to open yourself in a do@@ ors .
are they eight and mon@@ um@@ br@@ ating as $ 300 ?
we should put the bear into the fi@@ g .
the next day , this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what other me@@ tam@@ or@@ ders have run through ?
and i think there &apos;s almost a lot of con@@ tradi@@ ction .
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ brea@@ thing stick ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like another stam@@ p .
there isn &apos;t even online . there &apos;s no over@@ fu@@ el@@ ed .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; un@@ clear ever . &quot;
you &apos;re just going to go to google proje@@ c@@ tors .
you can see in all those muse@@ ums here .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
you get to zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can go in there .
i sell museum museum throughout the country glob@@ ally .
this is star night , never seen before .
and then we offer one of the great dis@@ hes .
now there &apos;s not many thousands of goals in this area .
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bom@@ b .
so we start with a win@@ dow@@ s-@@ bat@@ er .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t care at anything .
here we &apos;re talking about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
in fact , there &apos;s still potential and ag@@ gressi@@ ve ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
but this is a problem that &apos;s a problem .
this is the con@@ sequence that we have to ask ourselves .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
how much money is needed to realize this ?
there are some dig@@ its we can turn ourselves forward .
so , do they go out and start inv@@ enting them .
this was not a film , no h@@ d , that was real .
and it was a experience that didn &apos;t give me hollywood .
this is not a pris@@ on@@ er , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts in love .
and immediately , i see another pattern that creates .
so i step back and explore the perspective .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening picture of the film .
he said , &quot; the skin as a spon@@ ge .
i mentioned that towards mi@@ c@@ el and he nie@@ ced .
so that was really up@@ set , and i wanted to get more .
now , the energy em@@ pi@@ re is fallen over time .
in fact , the continu@@ ing society is based on energy supply .
now , where are we going to go : what is the right direction ?
what we need is a lot of companies who are working on this , hundreds of them .
the system is so healthy , rein@@ pul@@ ling the water .
a very con@@ cre@@ te desire that we rein@@ vent this technology .
it has a ma@@ pping of 15 to one .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
but in the acade@@ mic years , it wasn &apos;t like this .
yeah , here &apos;s the bur@@ den down there just the bur@@ den .
and then we have a whole load of simulation .
and so he &apos;s flying his na@@ dest states .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thank you .
this is an alternative one of the things that has been made .
it &apos;s the lo@@ vely , co@@ ok taste .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a biolog@@ ist in v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
i didn &apos;t even have a long time in mi@@ da@@ el .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the top lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the che@@ ers are the better the system . &quot;
here &apos;s a picture of an or@@ der@@ u@@ cky in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
but it turns out that this hasn &apos;t all happened .
i know what people think , when you see that .
i mean , why are we fighting this : why do we fight it ?
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here .
we can put this machine on everything that we want to do .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
that can be your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
you know , there was no mand@@ ela in par@@ ad@@ ise .
it &apos;s a debate about words about metaphor .
i hope you &apos;re going to enjoy it . thank you .
and my talk today is main@@ tain@@ ed by these cognitive dis@@ actions .
they were asked to report 60 seconds about their pain .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
i mean , how much do we get from our memor@@ ies ?
and then people could eat it , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ se@@ at@@ i .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
you can just name some names , and people will understand .
but , for the lower two billion , is it a disaster .
so , for example , the same team of one under the best .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died when they were 60 .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
di@@ ph@@ y , tu@@ tel@@ y , me@@ vi@@ sis ...
the fact is that this un@@ certain@@ ty to worry about .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
ask questions , ask the evidence , ur@@ ge the evidence .
that &apos;s a lot of dea@@ ths through the mas@@ ses , 20 per hour .
this is great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ industry industry .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in southern africa .
i can say the chan@@ ting is a man .
the no@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
and then , immediately , it falls to me , that &apos;s un@@ fair .
so people in the west have spent a long time of creativity in creativity .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it caused an enormous amount of ju@@ vers in the control room .
it &apos;s also my big , life@@ -@@ living love and fascin@@ ation .
and i &apos;m not expe@@ cting that the je will change .
how al@@ ga@@ e -- and other dre@@ am@@ ed things .
please follow me , because the circle will go up again .
this is an organis@@ m that we described in 199@@ 6 .
this is the audience that we &apos;ve done recently .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t manage it : thank you .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem much longer to be human .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
this is 20 feet of sea , as big .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious .
fro@@ sty , the man will clean up every day of cle@@ an@@ ers .
i want to just say a little about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
they have to ad@@ mit that this is a huge choice .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers , etc .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the strange stran@@ ger .
somewhere here , a series of photographs -- here they are .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
bla@@ ise , which is really incredible , thank you very much .
the u.s. is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
and i was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
a string of that was that the tele@@ phone never broke .
b has these advan@@ tages and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
why do you care about us when you don &apos;t buy ?
i won &apos;t tell you , because i want to use it .
mean@@ while , there &apos;s a political argu@@ er in our country .
or other models , or even technologi@@ cal fi@@ cations .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
you know , this is a fun process .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ al tree ?
that means that the bre@@ wers go back .
we &apos;ve run over three for three years now .
and will we replace oil from other amo@@ unts of energy .
that &apos;s not the efficiency efficiency , but efficiency produ@@ ces efficiency .
this is actually all the way in the del@@ u@@ sion phase .
and because we get older , the wind will get bigger .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really seriously ?
there were no ro@@ cket and he was like , &quot; so ? &quot;
it has only been the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ in-@@ half years .
so the music dis@@ plac@@ ement is the expan@@ sion of our body .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound of sound .
a baby takes about six thousand miles .
and also , what you would think about today is the spirit .
we have moved from this in the so-@@ called bird age .
we have an abstra@@ ct language .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide in the world .
so i know some of the people who don &apos;t care about .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories .
this is the kind of machine age age .
if you go far together , you go together . &quot;
so , how are the human being measu@@ red to things about .
we used to feel that things happen .
just as it used to happen on the village .
and of course , how does design impact on perception .
that &apos;s exactly what i described .
this is the space that you fall in in love .
there are other pleasure , but this is domin@@ ant .
it could be done within time in a ti@@ me@@ -@@ time learning .
the language of language was a small step into this direction .
let &apos;s take a lot of money , it costs a lot of money .
a government is absolutely critical , but it has to get efficient efficient .
what is this new state that takes over the world ?
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
in fact , we &apos;re also an addi@@ tional community .
mar@@ g@@ ant ? yes , alive ? jack .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
we see the process changing itself .
so , in a sense , the technology has taken us .
and ill@@ umin@@ ating the rest through the rest of the book .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
she was a sta@@ tic , strong woman , she had an effect .
if a neighb@@ or is helping , streng@@ x streng@@ ths , streng@@ then our communities .
my grand@@ father was in prison in the prison .
but what is the trick there is to be reali@@ stic ?
it &apos;s really about making different reali@@ ties together .
it was completely ex@@ tent that they could fail to fail .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
and the more obviously i was speaking , the more i should tell .
&quot; because she said this morning , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with them .
my un@@ cle died at al@@ co@@ hol industrial disease .
it gives you -- it gives you the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
you can see these are not three special pictures .
but you can put together something special about this .
secon@@ dly , they should com@@ bine photos the same ill@@ umin@@ ation of the same ligh@@ ting .
i &apos;m starting to start with an idea .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ vely .
and this video actually has been sent in janu@@ ary .
i studied young prin@@ ter and she was in brea@@ thing .
they put them on the be@@ at@@ al machine .
according to his behavior , we predict the structure and function .
we have the capital of tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat is 300 .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 .
and i got more and more aware of them .
in 2010 , we just had two billion people connected online .
he took a famous photograph . how did it tell you ?
she didn &apos;t treat any brain damage .
and this was the first time i did this myself .
the sandwi@@ ches describe them still as un@@ tou@@ ched .
and the fish also had lu@@ ck to be there .
i know that it was the bottom of the sea .
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to do ?
because the images li@@ f@@ ted it for them .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has got ma@@ ges .
i had a 14@@ -year-old poor black boys and mand@@ ers .
it &apos;s an amazing failure rate . one of nine is inno@@ cent .
and of course it can never pass it in germany . &quot;
and yet , there is this mental ab@@ du@@ sion .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against in@@ justice .
even who kill@@ s you is not just a mur@@ der@@ er .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of the language .
a few months passed over , and i had just for@@ gotten everything .
ten minutes later , the ju@@ dge has a pause .
that is that , for example , all of us is connected to the survival of every single individual .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded mis@@ use against drug drugs .
it slo@@ ws down for none of the great problems .
this is for everything that we &apos;re most creative about .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happ@@ ier .
h@@ h , w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ walls !
if we put in cities , this is actually a big deal .
but we know very little about where things go .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
if you &apos;re happy , you put other happy people up .
i s@@ mile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for somebody here in this audience in this audience .
it &apos;s not going to be the only way to fit into my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
in other words , game is our adap@@ ting jo@@ ker .
just that i think it &apos;s rather than that , right ?
we can do the same things in action with less energy .
but it actually was a greater enjo@@ y@@ ment of fun that night .
imagine taking this picture really to fly .
you interact with your environment and your experiences .
very rare , you &apos;re actually going to eat a ro@@ wing ic@@ e@@ berg .
if the kid &apos;s born , she looks like a girl .
i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ ph@@ any .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
and i don &apos;t only care about that , even though that &apos;s true .
how can we trans@@ fer those feelings from the games into reality ?
ok , imagine how extre@@ mes self-@@ self-@@ self-@@ self-@@ motiv@@ ated .
players are experts in the spi@@ der community community .
and this is an econom@@ ist . so it &apos;s logi@@ cal .
one of my friends has made it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ ing@@ ks .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i am not a hero .
or do you want them stron@@ ger , stron@@ ger , more force .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ds and beauty of biology .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tab@@ bac@@ co ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be facing .
and this is actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all the species of recogni@@ tion .
the more money you make is it .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with you , but not very often .
but my logi@@ cal page doesn &apos;t care .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
but what if you want to see the pain@@ t@@ ings ?
there &apos;s still potential for me , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is really cool stuff , it &apos;s called colle@@ ents .
for example , this is somebody who is fully logi@@ cal .
open the map , and jump along with a click .
click , and w@@ ing@@ ling , you &apos;re in this museum .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a tiny computer chip chip .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about right now .
there &apos;s even more behind it , it goes deeper .
so , of course , all of these subje@@ cts , of course , make a lot smaller decisions .
50 percent of their choices have been taken in at nine minutes or less .
it &apos;s you , you guys want to go to the end of the gang .
they &apos;re always worried that they lose a legal board .
and the film will be called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; un@@ cle ever . &quot;
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
so we should look better at what the target is .
the idea is to re@@ cover a digital security system .
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m technology to spread technology .
i &apos;ve worked in a coal factory -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been fil@@ ming in pris@@ ons -- hard and dangerous .
and i celebra@@ te , i see a little child .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of stat@@ ed .
you know , we hear a whole lot about transpar@@ ency .
tor@@ ney : i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
that &apos;s what i did . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be about .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was going to be changed .
this is simul@@ ating the ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay bay bay .
in@@ ot@@ ot@@ re is a cer@@ ti@@ fying place .
can you tell yourself if you &apos;re in a foreign age .
it became auto@@ auto@@ auto@@ t@@ ated , &quot; auto@@ matically . &quot;
a few years ago , i started to develop li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ ve@@ li@@ vi@@ d@@ ment into design schools .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of the flow of information trans@@ fer@@ red .
so i decided to be at 15 di@@ ver .
it &apos;s a ti@@ mber , but also a bird reser@@ ve .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
the program i &apos;ve used here is a little experiment .
you like to test it after my talk in your rooms .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize .
now , he mentioned the miner@@ als of physi@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
here he is he@@ ating a rare clo@@ thing .
and i was thri@@ ving them , an expedi@@ tion .
we have a force that can even create a reality .
it turns out , whether you get to get to zero .
you &apos;re basically just dan@@ gling , and some coming , other people not .
because it &apos;s not a lot of concern@@ s , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so , the one farm , which is not fe@@ eding their animals ?
but while you &apos;ve talked to people in the world about these opportunities .
conven@@ tional system looks like around the world like this .
and then we started to negoti@@ ate with the insu@@ l@@ ts .
because he doesn &apos;t know where ha@@ tions were first going to go first .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he dec@@ lar@@ ed them .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of all kinds of ideas .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering colle@@ c@@ tors .
they have a lot of rene@@ w@@ able energy from five percent .
you make the mistake , and you pay for a lot later .
they did that by raising the land .
this first one , which was more like a passionate ap@@ e .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one of the ? what fe@@ e@@ ds you ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask questions .
this second fish , which is another kind of love story .
let &apos;s call it mi@@ k@@ el , and it &apos;s mi@@ mi@@ el mi@@ gu@@ el .
in many , they &apos;ll say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s fine .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire@@ men .
we think about our future as a predic@@ t@@ ability memor@@ ies .
and this is a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
the first of those fall is a stri@@ ke , complexity .
what it didn &apos;t ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies on the experience .
now , the re@@ changing self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
it has e@@ ye@@ ger@@ es of life , one after another .
most of you will be completely ignor@@ ed by remem@@ ber@@ ing yourself .
and if i turn around , the fing@@ ers change its position .
there were no s@@ ant@@ a tree . we did all this stuff .
so i want you to think about a thou@@ ght-@@ study experiment .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the living self ?
we know money is very important .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at how emotions are going to go with income .
we &apos;re going to have a couple more people here in the next few days .
and she asked him what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and this is the value of experience , this simple exercise .
there &apos;s an e@@ mit program there .
usually most people normally start to t@@ ack@@ le yourself in the task .
they invest a lot of their time in the assem@@ bly building .
ce@@ o &apos;s something about average , but here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
this is not something that happened . not a team structure .
frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the research , it &apos;s just nu@@ t , how little it &apos;s been suppor@@ ting .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think i think .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous and we should care about us .
has one in the audience ever kill@@ ered somebody in mas@@ ses ?
they den@@ y your jud@@ gment anymore , they never do anything about them .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care system is mi@@ d .
the second is , if he &apos;s right , he has no sou@@ l .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ t@@ ings of the same adap@@ t@@ ability .
they feel the truth behind the out@@ come .
i believe that , and i have the feeling , that we should teach .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
she said it would be like a don@@ n@@ n@@ ine train of air .
and i guess that many of you have done this .
look at this as i could just write a song ?
i started to think , i should just catch the project .
i have to tell you : i think this was a big mistake .
we take images of this mini@@ -@@ ur@@ g@@ on in dete@@ c@@ tors .
the most powerful min@@ d@@ board is the director of mas@@ sey who &apos;s la@@ id in mas@@ sey who .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it sm@@ ells good .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean co@@ w technology .
so , if i put it together , you &apos;re always moving your interest .
if we over@@ do it , we can fight a little bit back .
i &apos;m not going to be able to take all of you on that journey .
how many do@@ ors did the house where you live ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
and i think it looks like the world looks like this .
this is an actual book , an example of non-@@ visual data .
maybe this is an artificial kind of book to read a book book book .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment in this environment .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al area of british colum@@ bia .
i think it &apos;s quite clearly in terms of what we need to do .
the second is , what econom@@ ists op@@ per@@ tun@@ an sk@@ ought is called .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement rate .
it turns out that dna syn@@ the@@ ti@@ zation is very difficult .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that there was no poetry .
so the device that you can see is not working .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
so , in any store , you can get things back .
i gam@@ ely play what these notes could mean .
they can ki@@ ck away where they go and stand .
that means that we are useful , not less har@@ m@@ ful .
the things that are only used , go into technical systems .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to help you with questions about the people in time for people to ask them .
there &apos;s a direct spin@@ es@@ hi@@ p system for this .
all in life that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
and most of all , questions about what &apos;s the right thing to do .
i take the breath of the audience , consci@@ ously , un@@ conscious and un@@ conscious .
then the same in a good , ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te conversation .
the x-@@ ent@@ al interpretation of a stick is this compar@@ able .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
if you walk , you know , every foot@@ print is fall@@ ing the ground .
that &apos;s actually what we &apos;re losing for the first year half of his ads .
the less i think about it , the more more more more more intui@@ tive .
i want to give you a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i need to cut so much off .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be at you .
but i still do it a little bit curious .
but also , how does it allow us to do it too .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting .
and another example is the ambi@@ gu@@ st-@@ intelligent systems , intelligent systems .
we see that that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
so , for example , h@@ ie the environment , get less of a car .
so , of course , we can look at the g@@ arb@@ age problem .
we could reduce this , of course , 10 percent , but what does it do ?
so the question is , how do we deal with these tun@@ as ?
here &apos;s the evidence of the fact that men don &apos;t have a pi@@ g .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
it &apos;s quite an amazing invention of thinking about it .
so today , evolution can happen in the time sp@@ an of micro@@ seconds .
because that is where the regi@@ me work has occu@@ pi@@ ed .
we need to get access to the government of government .
you have to introdu@@ ce the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
so , if you can do the lights again .
we have a lot of cells that are not being put on themselves .
and i don &apos;t necessarily think of it as a technical definition of the platform .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
so now we re@@ moved the sc@@ ales of time .
because their life depen@@ ded on whether you &apos;re doing the job proper@@ ly .
because all of these new technologies are born on themselves today .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
light bul@@ bs in a glass found all the way up .
and what happens is , what we call off@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
i didn &apos;t even learn them in my work as a law@@ yer .
do it impossible to say how the photo was put together .
and sure , we can find fa@@ st-@@ food cha@@ ins .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of opportunities .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s that look at this video .
we &apos;re not just finding pleasure in something we &apos;re doing .
the words , as long as his friends , mo@@ bes@@ i@@ zed one .
i knew that they had come to come to me .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
but where would be the next a@@ is@@ s to help this patient to help this patient ?
how did he get to find out on those special kinds of aid ?
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take somebody away .
the software of software takes a few years in usually a few years .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
i say , because i think identity is very important .
you &apos;ve got to make up 6@@ 2 different decisions to design your car completely differently .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
we still get to the gala@@ pa@@ gos in the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
i want to end with a story that really exc@@ ites me .
that means that the player hits 3 of 10 cu@@ ps .
i sent them home with my own doctor .
i went home with the emergen@@ cy waste trip .
i was sho@@ cked up and down to the inside .
and the best part of this could possibly be what &apos;s expected in the field of health .
this is tech innovation that is there today .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything changed .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is going to happen very quickly .
but they don &apos;t take the previous los@@ ses .
because marine prote@@ cted areas are basically coming back the past .
a long time ago there was gra@@ w@@ ling -- 500 years ago .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ second mar@@ g@@ in .
and what we found is that there was actually a relationship .
the ju@@ dge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
and i thought this is so hard to be so pain@@ ful .
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
we all need to believe the lat@@ est things that we can &apos;t see .
innovation , creativity , and development are not only coming out of our heads .
w@@ ing@@ ber@@ ing people were helping us the inno@@ cent con@@ vi@@ ction .
sometimes i lose the balance , a story to finish .
it was the fear of the ter@@ ror of her life .
cost for solar energy in the last year by 50 percent .
more and more people came together , because they were an@@ gry .
from my e@@ y@@ es@@ ight , i saw the jan@@ it@@ ors up and down .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black black .
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ van@@ son : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
then let &apos;s put this analog@@ y into the future .
car colors , sub@@ suit of the cars -- i have 5@@ 6 opportunities .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
it &apos;s a typical wal@@ -@@ m@@ art proce@@ d@@ ure of today for 10@@ 0,000 dollars .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
so they go around and do plastic instal@@ lations like this one .
think of this as a model as flying as flying as flying .
you see the person who as@@ ks what happens inside the inside .
i want to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
this is the average size of a big ice ber@@ gs .
so i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;ve brought to you .
i mean , what does someone do with so many out@@ put ?
but there was always a life@@ -@@ cycle cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer and you can see the descri@@ ption .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back into the room .
that st@@ ops us at the far and continu@@ ing continu@@ ing and continu@@ ing .
so the dra@@ wings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and i want to share with you my intui@@ tions for this week .
you &apos;re about the block , and you take it open to open .
what would you like if you could have one ?
would you not want to be able to do those things in your genes ?
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re about .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this , and play games .
and when you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure of that .
again , what potential would do for us now ?
the epi@@ ph@@ an is , death is part of life .
if you don &apos;t moved , you &apos;ve got bu@@ ried .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are with chimpanze@@ es to the next living related related to chimpanze@@ es .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
most of my time , i have two hat@@ s on them .
and as a general term , we can use this word intern@@ ality of intern@@ ality .
we &apos;re producing and@@ ro@@ gen , and we talk to and@@ ro@@ t@@ ters .
mt becomes part of the show , which is pretty slow .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game .
now , where would you take your brain on this scale ?
here i do something . we look at them here in the center .
if the museum gave us the image , they click on it .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
let &apos;s jump quickly to mom@@ a , back in new york .
in the present case , it was about finding parts .
it &apos;s not even from the mu@@ kes .
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
do you see a little nervous ? you see a little nervous .
so what i &apos;m just going to tell you about is something truly fantastic .
so just to pre@@ cis@@ ely , con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating sent@@ ences agre@@ ed .
i mean , this is just what my logi@@ cal page says .
you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
please get rid of the fear . get rid of the risk .
it was a store that was dra@@ g@@ ger .
i became a mira@@ cle to not dying this day .
look pretty much like the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ bly language language .
the pilot made the machine after heli@@ son river coming out .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my e@@ go room .
i hadn &apos;t hand@@ ed me for two years with my wife .
it &apos;s almost as if we &apos;re prepar@@ ing our lives on this .
i just wish i could grow my kids up .
i was the only one who could talk to the ac@@ tors .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t work like that .
so the driving force is the cyber@@ power super@@ power .
i don &apos;t know how recei@@ ving people will be people .
so , my gentle@@ man , you can help me ? i need help .
i really like your way , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
and the mo@@ tives of online crime are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
there are acci@@ dents of what of the in@@ ot@@ ot@@ re .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of in@@ ot@@ ot@@ re .
and within years , le@@ go , go into a hou@@ se@@ hold .
they put it in a green , and you can make light .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
this is really my skin . this is not an impact from hollywood .
okay , let me scrat@@ ch a little bit of blood for them .
it &apos;s just a sin of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
now , what caused it to the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a sa@@ d@@ le sa@@ d@@ or .
this is my skin . this is not an impact from hollywood .
what about children ? take this . why not ?
and this is something that we need to learn , that &apos;s very fast .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under studying explor@@ ers .
now , the living itself is going to be a living .
well , the two types of self will take two terms of happiness from happiness .
and this is what i wanted to study as a ph@@ .@@ d. student .
we &apos;re going to come to collabor@@ ative thinking , heart creatures .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
my inspiration comes from an event , which is 2,@@ 500 years behind .
well , i said , how can i actually push this ?
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ able energy , which is often called .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building si@@ del@@ ines , not inten@@ se inten@@ sity .
i grew up with a dea@@ f por@@ tion of science .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of planets on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that go to zero .
people here have contribu@@ ted many of this most of this wonder .
we &apos;re playing games to deal with the suffering of the physical world .
and soon , i wrote a paper on the genetic food food .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ or skills and their power to succe@@ ed .
so i offer a 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar price for software for the future .
they produced the highest structure in the lo@@ west time .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
the small@@ po@@ x . pop billions of people on this planet killed billions of people on this planet .
so what we do is it en@@ ables the connections of connection , trust , trust and other .
i asked him how he became such a fishing experts .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big deal .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebra@@ te .
we find other at@@ tribu@@ tes about what their rights are .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation of ourselves .
i brought seven pa@@ irs with me , and that &apos;s all .
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
you talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and i had to explain the journ@@ alists that there is not there .
and the question was : how could you com@@ bine technology , new technology with it ?
imagine that every single one of the people is being oper@@ ated .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a potential for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
and i was like , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human .
i started to put it in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
that &apos;s actually the kind of disappe@@ ars of human and machine .
but nothing was invented that would leave me back until now .
there are a few , probably as many as there are creative people here .
well , most people i like to see as a doctor .
if you could only have one of those , it would be a very different world .
so this is a wonderful sil@@ ent environment for these bacteria .
this is all the reality , and the future is going to be much more possible .
we &apos;re de@@ gra@@ ding one person who has value value for our society .
and our nation is based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
he said , &quot; z@@ os , you need to go into the house .
the secret is that the game is the game of those skills .
now , if it &apos;s har@@ dly appropriate , it may be the most important thing to do .
and this is called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic reci@@ pes .
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ ster@@ i@@ cient .
and the defin@@ ing indi@@ c@@ ator is the extin@@ ct of languages .
this is a fishing line in the southern western corner of spa@@ in .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest te@@ a down there on the right .
most people know about it from the software table .
by the end , the l@@ h@@ c will re@@ generate .
people said : did you have no fear , never succe@@ ed ?
but instead of eating in pan@@ ic , he just stopped .
finally , a solution that is enough enough to solve our problems .
new invest@@ ments to create good jobs .
on september 17@@ th year , the machine ran up for the first time .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introdu@@ ction to l@@ h@@ c .
this actually has taken a two-@@ minute picture , which is these networks .
and there &apos;s a co@@ st-@@ to-@@ the-@@ art scan .
there , in my opini@@ on , i think , a really good code .
so this is just an app@@ lic@@ ation of a lot that you can do with it .
i think sort of si@@ x-@@ po@@ t dollars , or something like that .
it means that we &apos;ve made a cultural impact on the scientific issue .
and this is just the bio@@ ha@@ cker , the individual people .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this has stru@@ yed me when i wanted to get my je@@ ans .
in the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ vision of view .
the modern industrial world like us is har@@ dly 300 years old .
it is our new home and is n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ist .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control all the miner@@ als .
now this is actually live in the internet . you can check it out .
the interesting thing is , if i can take a little clip .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of things out there .
i could not have liked it . i haven &apos;t de@@ vot@@ ed it .
is it clear that the answer to the question is , it &apos;s .
they increase the paraly@@ sis , and sen@@ ds that satis@@ fac@@ tion .
and , if we can do that , we can start from the chromo@@ some ?
so this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ te .
so , i think it &apos;s a very yellow ha@@ ck .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths is through through through through through through through through sch@@ ol@@ ars .
there was no piano at the time .
from that time there &apos;s an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you might be aware of .
the one is getting more and more of a friend that you live with .
you learn to find the sound on the instrument on the instrument .
lou@@ dly and a half , etc , , etc . , etc .
it doesn &apos;t need to take a lo@@ an or sing to you .
there &apos;s a lot of compe@@ tent that this diagno@@ sis was diagno@@ sed ?
no@@ ti@@ zed gra@@ des have made the function of the letters of a scri@@ pt .
and i &apos;m not sure whether you really re@@ main .
one day the mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a much more beautiful one .
the person is going to come from the mon@@ keys or a common ance@@ st@@ or .
but cri@@ tically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s .
there were the nuclear fis@@ her@@ o@@ po@@ d@@ d@@ d@@ ons .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s viol@@ in@@ ary .
how were the living conditions like society and politics ?
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
so i began to see when , of course , what &apos;s , of course , or intui@@ tive .
and six@@ ten milli@@ seconds , a very interesting phenomenon .
and they made it with such a so-@@ called le@@ ad@@ -@@ agri@@ cultural cards .
that means , you know , you over@@ -@@ per@@ si@@ sted sound and rhyth@@ m .
so , unfortunately , we have lost a piece of virtual prote@@ cted virtu@@ es .
and then the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy im@@ pac@@ ts of the industrial culture .
and this is also what i had over the last hal@@ f-@@ year .
that &apos;s continu@@ ing a lot continu@@ ing in the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
that means that it &apos;s efficiency , not efficiency .
this is the most per@@ cep@@ tions of most per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
if we don &apos;t have a phosp@@ hor@@ us and give off .
here it says , the more the better , the better .
now , if you &apos;re going to sho@@ ot , you would have emissions .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people , you can &apos;t be very sick .
so we have a device that is completely free of restri@@ ction .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so re@@ gre@@ t .
in many areas , people had to be terri@@ bly afraid of ly@@ n@@ n@@ bs .
i got into the car and was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
how can a ju@@ dge someone turn into something that is not ?
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
if somebody sees lying , it isn &apos;t just a li@@ ar .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on our humanity .
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be hor@@ ses .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
now , in fact , the number of non@@ violent changes has not changed very much .
i have some talks in germany over the death pen@@ al@@ ty pen@@ al@@ ty .
: social waste . speak@@ ers : 65 dea@@ ths , 65 dea@@ ths .
but somehow , somehow we can do it from this problem .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
in my opini@@ on , mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ations trans@@ formed our world fundament@@ ally .
i looked at them and s@@ mil@@ ing , but she looked very seriously .
in the short time here , one of the ted has been an identity .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ key mon@@ soon . &quot;
this piece of 50 years old was the most ma@@ gical thing to me .
5@@ 6 percent of the ra@@ pe cases are not cases of trial .
and the tr@@ ash of tr@@ ash goes home . went home .
that &apos;s why the dra@@ matic pay for the prison pris@@ on@@ ers in pris@@ on@@ ers .
&quot; she is back , &quot; she said in this particular pit@@ ch .
and when i was listening to her , she made ke@@ u@@ ch@@ at sounds .
and the best part is that you connect to magne@@ ts together .
essentially , the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is re@@ moved to the building block of time .
somebody was broken , and had the system ha@@ cked .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but i can make life .
and what i learned is that er@@ ror is absolutely in@@ trin@@ si@@ ble .
in some of the last five years , the last five years have happened .
i looked into the ra@@ ge , and it was a little bit p@@ ink .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government , when i started this program .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i love this : wat@@ son be@@ ds to see humanity &apos;s ad@@ v@@ ance . &quot;
and i was good , i gradu@@ ated with c@@ ship lou@@ der .
and this is the message that i took in medical school .
you know how to call a 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ baseball in a lot of lea@@ gue baseball ?
how about these contribu@@ tions that we can &apos;t even make ?
how about a sentence of normal , never listen@@ ed to .
he &apos;s invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
it &apos;s about making out of che@@ wing goods .
so it &apos;s programs that can sort of b@@ low up the highest nu@@ cle@@ ers .
now there &apos;s all of this m@@ b in the great un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling of the big con@@ sol@@ ation .
these people will be connected to the film in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty for forever .
so all these green sett@@ ings , these are the most tar@@ ge@@ ted environments .
if you could do it for those things , you could help me .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
i like a lot of black colors , many gra@@ ms and such a stuff .
so maybe you want to put it in front of the interview . &quot;
it &apos;s un@@ thin@@ k@@ able -- like these strange agri@@ cultural street .
and just as disappe@@ ared all companies disappe@@ ared , one after another .
if you look at the people you have to do it ...
i like things that are weird , and i like a special thing to do .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
an ei@@ ght-@@ leg@@ ged , mar@@ ke . how did your brand ?
and when you are at risk , things are really bad things .
of course , this cannot be done by a human leaders .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
here &apos;s a clip from that attack code code .
and this ur@@ gen@@ cy , this is really changing my life .
i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve about it .
what rel@@ ates to the thoughts and feeling about yourself ?
we &apos;ve be@@ gun his bed , so he can look outside .
why is it important to start neu@@ qu@@ ely ? what represents the red ?
but in youtube , more than 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ plo@@ aded .
my friends of hon@@ e@@ as have asked me to say , thank you ted .
this is my w@@ inner wa@@ vy . a very simple thing .
for example , the fish was taken on a sho@@ ot@@ ing trip .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed photos should have the same perspective .
photographs like this : a building along a lot of the road is along the road .
three months later , i moved , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ ed .
it &apos;s not allowed to be em@@ bol@@ den@@ ed by opportunities that have been ex@@ pli@@ min@@ ly encoura@@ ged .
the biggest sc@@ or@@ es , ra@@ pe and death .
and it has really spread , of course , of course .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
this is actually just a period of two weeks of two weeks .
in this air@@ port , a hundred square squ@@ ar@@ es of squ@@ ar@@ ls .
so it turns out to be very hard to get rid of all this exten@@ sion .
so , a few years ago , i decided to do that , just to do that .
but at the same time , we need a good fra@@ ction of the experiments of the experiments .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about this .
after all , at trial , we should wel@@ come the fear of wel@@ come .
well , finally , the film has a very big moment@@ um .
we have de@@ dic@@ ated li@@ ve@@ li@@ vi@@ ties of kids , and they see them playing with them .
and there &apos;s 60 years and it &apos;s done for 60 years , and it &apos;s finished .
a nuclear re@@ actor , which gives itself a solution to waste .
now this is fundamental al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s do it .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the computer is a mira@@ cle .
the ur@@ ani@@ um is going to require gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
if we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 to@@ il look like ?
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill him .
the answer is : until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to go up .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tic@@ als were in very different cam@@ ps .
and this is a min@@ d@@ set that i measure for .
i think this is not a wonder , and no , that &apos;s not a wonder .
we type , we pass it , that &apos;s okay .
h@@ h studies have been done to see if the vot@@ ing was true .
everybody &apos;s about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
he was rele@@ ased by one of the worst human@@ i@@ ties of humanity .
and who sees that is that it &apos;s especially true for men .
but even in this restri@@ cts , we can do a lot of things .
i said , &quot; mi@@ che@@ el , don &apos;t drop your fish ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing eg@@ gs to the birds .
it &apos;s the last ance@@ stry before something in your body gets into it .
because if the water comes out in the atlan@@ tic .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
that &apos;s just to realize if you take a step back and look at this whole thing .
so we can jump up and take a look at all the ted prize .
and so i want to show you what a little bit of a surprise could be a surprise .
and here i can go into the site and re@@ f@@ use them again .
and we became a new family of four@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years into a right family .
and you can do it because it doesn &apos;t connect and cor@@ relation .
it &apos;s about five miles up to one , &quot; he said .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
if we &apos;re going to make predic@@ tions , this kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
it &apos;s people who believe that as individual world can change the world .
in front of these fab@@ ul@@ ous clay controll@@ ers there were she@@ pher@@ d she@@ pher@@ ds .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a syn@@ syn@@ enter dic@@ tion@@ ary in time .
and i tend to try to see things like my sha@@ do@@ ws .
this is a photograph@@ y of photograph@@ y to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m kid@@ ding computer games .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it la@@ sted 13 years .
there are 2@@ 8 million people in the world who are now prote@@ cted in a wheel@@ chair in a chair .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back .
to ada@@ pt to an un@@ conven@@ i@@ ent world , we need to play games .
under a hu@@ t , i &apos;m dealing with the story of an@@ atom@@ y .
we think that in reality , we don &apos;t care as well as games .
you can see what are the enormous speed opportunities there .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing stories .
we love to hi@@ de us in lying , we love this .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
and all i can say is , why do we fight that ?
so a de@@ ception becomes a little bit of a ca@@ ke because somebody makes it so e@@ ager .
the kni@@ fe that you can study ; my hand that you can study .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any child brea@@ thing , and you know what ?
we know something about what the happiness of happiness determin@@ es itself .
and they &apos;re going to ask them , &quot; who of the two has more e@@ aten ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es .
from the point of view of yourself , b was clearly a worse time .
they &apos;re very , very important , and in this case , domin@@ ated the end .
well , these are three weeks , and this is at the end and a half hours .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new life opportunities .
then we have to re@@ constru@@ ct our pri@@ cing capacity in the net .
i wrote four sti@@ cks , and i want to explain to you a little bit about it .
it has been a very important tool for the information facili@@ zation of time .
and the pro@@ position was to build a lot of carbon fac@@ tors .
the future is here , wind , sun and a new energy system .
you put it together with a certain sound and ten@@ ds to put it in .
and then the company is opening up under the head@@ line and citi@@ zen science .
and this is the core of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
there &apos;s always your contribu@@ tion to your contribu@@ tion , which is whatever he wants to be .
that &apos;s one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tures of a creative life .
what the hell of course is extremely counter@@ intui@@ tive and it &apos;s a computer game .
now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on glob@@ al-@@ scale .
and look at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
and the most important thing is to look at the ground than the first thing .
you can only have zer@@ o-@@ le@@ mis@@ sions when you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how are we going to deal with it .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents .
now , how do we start to do a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
to put it in my context : i was born in 194@@ 6 .
but how would it be if the image is connected to all their pictures ?
the off@@ ic@@ er belie@@ fs of all western developed societies .
they r@@ ented their phone ; they didn &apos;t buy it ; they didn &apos;t buy them .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that does not do too much .
why ? i wrote an entire book to try to explain myself .
this is high tech agri@@ cultural , but the facili@@ ties are put themselves together .
he ended up running all the way , and doing something completely new .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different metho@@ ds .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
and the answer -- the quick answer to all these questions : : did you .
this search led to the old gre@@ en-@@ e@@ al and the old ro@@ me .
if your work fle@@ ts -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
right now , we can get those kinds of nutri@@ tional nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of the car , you can see here .
the first sentence is clear to cla@@ im , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
and if i &apos;m right , the chan@@ nel is a man in a man .
and then pi@@ cking up , so he gave them your insi@@ ght into them .
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire@@ men .
so i want to leave you with what we found in my institute .
this is actually a three-@@ sentence that descri@@ bes us with a lo@@ gic .
so to lie , that you can actually use this lo@@ gic .
that was the very first start of my own tech expression .
an art piece that you can never look at has no power to do .
if i don &apos;t right , the can@@ z@@ men is not a man .
because we actually need to prove whether it &apos;s the sou@@ l or not .
the same forces with ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ -@@ ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed mar@@ ks each one on one another .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or nuclear facili@@ ties .
this is conser@@ va@@ tive from asia , in the tra@@ cks from japan .
and as i say the word justice , this is un@@ comfortable feeling away .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery battery .
you collect information about the piece in the se@@ a@@ tic liter@@ ature .
so to give them y@@ ourselves , right with the com@@ pos@@ ites .
but if i ask you how to do it with your wife ?
now there &apos;s a lot of people who are working on them , and they &apos;re all enga@@ ged in themselves .
interpre@@ tes are interpre@@ ted by the written notes in clinical music .
that would be only the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of letters is first when you get the language .
because the fr@@ ance could be the best of the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
why are i going to ask about my audience that there is also active ?
often , the music class is so much that you only read the notes that you only read the notes .
you &apos;re learning perfectly first before you talk only one word .
so the ham@@ mer@@ ds in the piano are the continu@@ ing of my fing@@ ers .
listen to them , and say , if it &apos;s bu@@ sted or not .
if the music is lo@@ cated in front of them or swe@@ et .
at the same time , we re@@ gar@@ ded in all kinds of in@@ conven@@ i@@ ently in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
of course my grandmother would say all of her grand@@ children , they be something special .
she said , &quot; what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
imag@@ in@@ y@@ books have already had maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and star@@ ing me .
she said , &quot; a@@ ye ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
my story begins over here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
the united states today has the highest rate of in@@ in@@ trin@@ si@@ c rate .
and each being uses exactly the ex@@ act same letter and the same code .
sometimes you can get these ideas to our thinking , in an important way of thinking about , in a sense .
after all , i got out of my car , and went to the dis@@ h .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve actually deli@@ vered a string to the sound .
it put images and text together , and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
this is the result of moving computers that build the faster computers .
now we know nine cities that are planning to use this ap@@ p to use this ap@@ p .
this is not political , this is bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic active .
and they developed great app@@ s , working with urban collabor@@ ators .
you agre@@ ed to him , if it sta@@ yed .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regi@@ me technology .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent of water .
and not even like a tech company , but rather than the internet itself .
and i want to look at this in the scale of the world of the world .
and this app@@ s let us use our hands to improve our communities .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , bor@@ ing slide .
something more substan@@ tial because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
: tsun@@ am@@ i@@ war@@ cy . speak@@ er : cyber@@ attack .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with me , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 who on twitter .
today , to do@@ zens of enter@@ prise , we can do this already .
and the reason is , the government could come back where a text came from .
it shows you how much happens when governments are attac@@ king their own citizens .
this shows the enor@@ m@@ ously big role of the marine reser@@ ve .
because it &apos;s a little wa@@ x , in a sense that &apos;s lost in a way .
they also had to regi@@ ster a she@@ et with an un@@ text sound from this ty@@ pe@@ writer .
and at the end , you just want to get the in@@ her@@ ure super@@ per@@ si@@ ble .
and this is one of the three major sources of the no@@ where of today , online online problems .
you may think that he was fin@@ ishing , but that &apos;s not true .
these are the questions that we need to go through for the next 50 years .
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out with this .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
of course , many people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ m that it was really important .
so it &apos;s really about to capture an idea as a moment of having a moment of understanding .
and i think it &apos;s a medical age , and i am .
you say that you never forget the names of those who are dying .
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology on the way , nan@@ o materials .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to go up by two billion internet users .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors , etc .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years now , but now .
&quot; do you remember the patients she ic@@ ed home ? &quot;
what you need is an environment which is able to do it in the position .
if you &apos;re doing re@@ je@@ ction , and you never make the mistake again .
and as he walked out of the door , he showed him on his ra@@ cks .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the ri@@ ght-@@ hand ra@@ ws ? &quot; &quot;
and over 10,000 e@@ ds already passed into the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we have two creatures , both in the 197@@ 9 , in the same day .
but in fact , this is actually completely re@@ moved from photographs of different places .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
it &apos;s much more challen@@ ging than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s going to come up with a sp@@ ell right away .
and i say to people that i don &apos;t want to go to like a scientist .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of that i want to share with you today .
did anyone see the film bu@@ tter@@ fly and di@@ ver bell ?
they knew all the bits and by@@ b@@ b that had to attack them .
so we decided , tony -- mt -- and his thing to support .
this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran is divi@@ ded by something called r@@ ls .
and not the gun leaders , the security system is going to notice it .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to finish .
everybody can actually communicate with their eyes , or draw .
no@@ wa@@ days , more than any time , get us a little bit more comfortable with us .
it was like the foot@@ ball world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
but this is a lot of in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ced , and more complicated things .
i grew up with a mother that taught me the day for day for days .
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
we should be able to ro@@ ot everything we want .
that &apos;s the staf@@ f , in the national sci@@ ences .
and a half , the people making a short call , go to toi@@ lets .
and just like that , you show the ic@@ e@@ berg a different aspe@@ ct of his own person@@ ality .
it &apos;s real real 3d scan and a movement .
it &apos;s something that we work on the olymp@@ ics games in london .
this has all di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , you know , and it &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble to the internet .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; -- which is what it takes us ?
so how do we change the question of the character of character ?
big data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world in large opportunities in the world .
now there &apos;s 10,000 par@@ o@@ di@@ ans of fri@@ day at fri@@ day at youtube .
the frame@@ work from the la@@ da@@ stri@@ a came out of the rest of the world .
we can deal with more cat@@ categ@@ ories than with more choices .
because categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until next satur@@ day .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure of pleasure .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as ow@@ ners of our po@@ pop culture .
well , think of how well , you think , are you in the decisions ?
before i close this talk , i would like to tell you about my grandmother .
now i would like to have my own kids , and i think this is the boat .
and also , t@@ ans &apos;s mom is here in the fourth or five row .
okay . everybody &apos;s willing to offer g@@ ary &apos;s supply .
photographs where you need to think a short moment to try and find out the trick .
they &apos;re just building the building of a@@ partment against the cities of cities .
he was dem@@ and@@ ing for oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be rob@@ ust .
and here &apos;s a really big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so i made this thing on a very similar way that you make a computer chip chip .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics is that un@@ mov@@ able objects in the same way too .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things like that .
you could try to exp@@ and the capacity of exi@@ sting a@@ ims already .
all the par@@ ties , all the issues of society , suppor@@ ted this .
in the mean@@ time , i applied myself to ted@@ global .
and we said , &quot; let &apos;s give this the person who &apos;s off@@ ic@@ ers , &quot; i want to say , &quot; well , let &apos;s give this the pres@@ ence of our country . &quot;
so i sat down , and you &apos;ve played the ted@@ talk ab@@ ding .
over the simple game , li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its actually nar@@ ro@@ ws very powerful .
here &apos;s the state of all the demon@@ stration i thought to this .
and i can sort of re@@ cover everything i &apos;ve been seeing today .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because food is better . &quot;
we &apos;re not reali@@ zing , we enjoy . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
this is , in two billion years of des@@ cen@@ ded labor .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not for content itself ?
so i can zo@@ om in in a particular period of time .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds in this place .
in the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the ar@@ gent@@ ina &apos; hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
right now , in the world , think that data is a s@@ wal@@ low .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get rid of it .
so films were the path , images and stories together , the adap@@ ting together .
they don &apos;t exist in a sun@@ light system , as we do it .
i don &apos;t know much about leadership before i started this expedi@@ tions .
and so in 198@@ 2 , in 198@@ 2 has bought a very span@@ ish company with the country .
co2 war@@ ms the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
if you did this somewhere , it takes away .
and we can actually zo@@ om in with this great battery two milli@@ seconds .
and now we feel the consciousness immediately , and you can do something .
that has to do with that , that we go back into the four@@ fold century .
if you put more wind together , the system begins to fail .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants because it &apos;s particularly everywhere everywhere .
we were only five people back to re@@ building the society .
and it goes on at 9 billion , which is moving down at 9 billion .
who can make a fish so well if it was co@@ ok ?
we &apos;ve got tri@@ an@@ ger@@ -@@ si@@ gh@@ ted photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic in germany .
there &apos;s going to be a whole load of od@@ ds , and there are stri@@ kes .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we are basically a world &apos;s own world .
so i called at the next day , just before the event , sh@@ an .
a de@@ cent journalist had been talked about this fish from this fish .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
it &apos;s something which isn &apos;t stop , materi@@ tically , it &apos;s natural .
and gam@@ ers are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
we &apos;ve developed the game super@@ lo@@ ct at the institute of the future for future .
or , &quot; how did your journey go to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
actually , we don &apos;t actually choose to take any experience . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
well , you would know something about its hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a whole lot of time games games . &quot;
why is it impossible to think , you could &apos;t reach anything ?
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see it . &quot;
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the kni@@ fe .
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t care about me .
most of the time in this study was that teachers didn &apos;t have been di@@ ved .
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in a spe@@ phan@@ age ?
and one night , there is a p@@ at on his hot@@ p@@ ine door door .
in front of front of him , a beautiful sho@@ w@@ girl .
i would show my arm and show you that there &apos;s no gone .
it &apos;s impossible to represent things like a society that work to represent .
h@@ h studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious business .
he &apos;s actually developed a pair of other people &apos;s vac@@ cin@@ es .
in your imagination , le@@ ak@@ y and prob@@ ability of something really descri@@ bes into your life ?
and with each attemp@@ t to get kids feedback feedback , and what doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable . you see this team , and you see this team going to win . &quot;
so is it not interesting that the competition is a strong effect ?
these were the people , educ@@ ated people , an@@ x@@ iety people .
i &apos;ve had time , ge@@ other@@ times , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
you can see it in the same way , but you can see if you want .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her her child , no way .
this is okay , you like to see 28 billion dollars for your dark ur@@ ine in numbers .
it &apos;s not about the genes pass . it &apos;s not about the chemicals .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , and so this was an amazing thing to me .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , and let &apos;s make it look real .
here you need something lo@@ gic , but the will@@ ing@@ ness of lying .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the wal@@ der , which was amazing .
the sou@@ l is kind of ti@@ red , say about some b@@ ni@@ z .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most larger problem .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection is two campaig@@ ns in the lives of life .
it &apos;s an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life@@ work .
in fact , he can &apos;t feel really an@@ nu@@ or@@ an@@ cent .
this is not at all my creative process -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel !
but even in my mouth , i &apos;ve got this thing up .
but if you de@@ fy it , most of the drin@@ king water is going to fall away .
do you have no fear that your de@@ fe@@ est@@ ation kill@@ s you ?
and i promis@@ ed to come back to tell them how the machine works .
for example , for example , the care of a 100 percent cle@@ aner is new , within the next 10 years .
it turns out that he wanted to just st@@ ack the si@@ gh@@ ts of stac@@ ks .
each one has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ ct what you want to use .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
but that &apos;s always the way that it &apos;s easy to be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and i have a lot more of things that nobody would be expe@@ cting .
and then i have a sa@@ van@@ es@@ po@@ der , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
we all know about what &apos;s bad about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about this .
all those choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
that meant that he was completely re@@ moved during the chinese invasi@@ on .
there &apos;s been up@@ sta@@ tic up on the top of nasa .
but the spa@@ tial order of images is actually meaning .
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i have time to show you other environments .
this is actually a poster poster , which is really recor@@ ded .
and what &apos;s also interesting is , that you have come into a sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
this is not an electr@@ on microscop@@ ic graph that &apos;s a regular microscop@@ ic graph .
wonderful beach . great after@@ noon . they have all of it for themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world over the last generation in the last generation .
it &apos;s making it really possible to make the chemistry of stuff that never has been done before ?
a chromo@@ some is just a piece of in@@ spir@@ ing chemical material .
you can see that his chromo@@ some is just apart from each other .
and it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of things about this .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not hel@@ pl@@ ed by music today .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself yourself , if you get bor@@ ed .
if you throw out the wrong things , you have a tr@@ ash problem .
as a director of a piece of music , i first have the written notes .
i say to my own words , which might be written between this frame@@ work .
all of this affec@@ ts me and all this is my experience with the com@@ position .
he asked me what the sub@@ stance of this balance was for me .
that means that we don &apos;t care about people , there are little bad to be here .
we do that in china , for example , where we take the acci@@ dents of that .
but please don &apos;t say anything about classi@@ cal music , i don &apos;t understand anything about classi@@ cal music .
so you can listen to them , what you &apos;ve just heard in the spirit .
i say , ul@@ f , what are you going to need to be a big car ?
you can try that with words like ra@@ ven@@ or or prof@@ its or something like that .
it makes you feel that it &apos;s very easy to understand that it has a very different sense that it has a very different sense .
there is op@@ e@@ c , a bag of or@@ phan@@ hi@@ bs .
this is a little bu@@ mp that &apos;s not really interested in fire@@ resol@@ ution .
and then again , it &apos;s going to come back and it &apos;s actually been seen .
and this is the proje@@ ction of vision , feedback , see .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come up from the top a to b ?
what caused influ@@ ences on our thinking and on our re@@ ven@@ u@@ es ?
then the next generation , in which we actually live in today .
and those two are all starting to look like , new and old thinking .
a lot of use the word , however , didn &apos;t care what to do .
so , in part , with these ha@@ d@@ y-@@ spaces , these places put together in these places together .
we do it in brazil , where we re@@ gain the nutri@@ ents .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody is talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ -@@ solving problem .
in the soil , over sea percent of carbon dio@@ xide .
tradition@@ ally , we think , in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many on the world .
you can only be a cli@@ o@@ neu@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ?
they &apos;ve heard a little bit about popu@@ lations of trees from trees ?
she looks at it , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do it . do you care . &quot;
it was something that , you know , you wanted to be in your near .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ irs , who said the great di@@ vin@@ al politi@@ cian once said .
they come from ideas that are driven by the con@@ vi@@ ction in our he@@ arts .
we &apos;re doing this . so , as we &apos;re so rational , as we are , as much as we &apos;re intelle@@ ct .
but think of a way that &apos;s integr@@ ated in our own life .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of those ingre@@ di@@ ents have in the histor@@ ical context .
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ american in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
but you can also think differently depen@@ ding on how we see our identity .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in ha@@ f@@ ful and in prison .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started argu@@ ing .
there &apos;s a drug war : mass destruction of g@@ uns . gold na@@ do .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a in virg@@ ini@@ a as sla@@ ves .
and we bring them back into a more con@@ temporary history for kids .
this map is going to grow and use it in the rest of the book .
i &apos;m just going to go to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
i don &apos;t know what any single transi@@ st@@ or in the rela@@ x@@ or machine does .
so this allows us to do this again as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
in other words , every step here is a power in circu@@ it scale .
this is a slide that i pres@@ ented from my fi@@ ber .
that we are more than the worst , what we &apos;ve ever done .
a citi@@ zen citizens helped another citi@@ zen , but the government was playing in a central role .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the cour@@ ts@@ room ? &quot;
how can i tell you my er@@ ror so that you don &apos;t go to the same floor ?
he had a potential of life@@ -@@ living disease called epi@@ gl@@ et@@ ti@@ tis .
light , sound , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
they &apos;re pre@@ fer@@ red , light , sound , motor and sen@@ sor .
they had this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 y@@ ards to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
in these recor@@ ds , a fol@@ der called &quot; fin@@ fish &quot; .
over time , there &apos;s always little fish , and we think that &apos;s worth the extin@@ ct .
they didn &apos;t eat , they were waiting , because they were dead .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to be working in europe later .
in this state , roughly 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans in the state of dea@@ ths .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the animal level .
the basis of many of these are technologies , and these are growing ex@@ potential .
it turns out that it infe@@ cted a stre@@ tch infe@@ ction .
why didn &apos;t i ask the high school ? why did i call them home ?
and it wasn &apos;t on my top , he was very happy .
and after two , three days , that she had never seen again .
and it worked for a while for a while , until i car@@ ried pr@@ inter@@ s .
it &apos;s much better this year ; it &apos;s on the ris@@ ing bran@@ ch .
it &apos;s not about c@@ at , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ ble .
king from the king of silicon al@@ umin@@ um bri@@ ck .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the state of citi@@ zen@@ ship .
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to pre@@ tend life &apos;s largest life .
it makes a sense of water as a result of sc@@ or@@ es of water .
now , this is our environment for the first time , to respond to us .
maybe they even knew the sho@@ ot@@ ine of the machine interface .
the pilot had wa@@ sted , and we were not so far away .
think of a great explosion , as you go up to 1,000 feet .
and you know , this part of the life needs anything that needs everything else of the rest of life .
so we &apos;re starting to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
mt was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti of 8@@ 0s .
and we could get a building in a building for the exp@@ o exp@@ o .
we need to introdu@@ ce the consequences , and we start to pre@@ p@@ are at ourselves .
what politicians say is , our president says it , even our ce@@ o says it , even our ce@@ o says it , even our ce@@ o says it .
if all the answers are l@@ oud , i feel myself as if i won .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
now , in practice , people are not te@@ sted to their chromo@@ some .
and they have a really wonderful way of prepar@@ ing the future civil rights movement .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
so sex games are distribu@@ ted , both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s as well as humans .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like humans -- love to play their life long for his life .
but unfortunately bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at the least familiar .
and this gave us a great insi@@ ght for what we &apos;ve investi@@ g@@ ated here .
at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics , we call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
there &apos;s only one and those are the united states -- lu@@ ck@@ ily lu@@ ck@@ ily lu@@ ck@@ ily lu@@ ck@@ ily .
every single harvard employees put up auto@@ matically on a life@@ -@@ time fund .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; restri@@ es . &quot;
but what they really do is show up what today is possible today .
and you can achieve it through these kinds of ways , but through crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
because this is a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
what revol@@ t@@ led books can write , which is so sc@@ ary ?
if you want to know it : those other pe@@ ers are also fre@@ ed days .
because you &apos;re able to do that , if you call yo@@ se@@ mi@@ a mountain green .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , part , and un@@ expected .
go from the little choice to many , then you stick with it .
he &apos;s ti@@ ming &quot; pre@@ vent@@ ites &quot; in the off@@ ic@@ al dat@@ ab@@ ase .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you an ex@@ tent so@@ cket .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it is where we are today .
there are two cities in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation .
how would you deal with that that your body is oc@@ curr@@ ing in the room ?
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full el@@ ev@@ ator ?
he was still a little kid and not very good at it , and he always brea@@ th@@ es .
i remember a kid playing on a bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om in a field of time .
in fact , to go close to the side , you can go up to the side .
each one of the things that we &apos;re going to do is get rid of the risk .
it &apos;s a hum@@ ster k@@ y-@@ z , which is fear in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear , mod@@ ul@@ ent , liquid , liquid .
you talk about how it &apos;s going to look like , they mul@@ n around power .
and when we know knowledge , maybe we can even get even better from that .
so the set was a very accu@@ rate copy of the ship plans of the ship .
no h@@ unt , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
and the answer of your team is more important than the l@@ ing@@ s of the world .
now , if i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
we immediately get a sense of the top@@ ics that are at the most popular .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the popular arb@@ it@@ u@@ ans in wikipedia .
what you might ask is : how does this happen ? why is that ?
it &apos;s because ways that you don &apos;t go back on this planet , you go forward .
that number goes up , and it &apos;s very quick , and that &apos;s the sh@@ ame .
i think we can deliver this world with energy that doesn &apos;t simul@@ tane@@ l them at the same time .
okay , and i think there are some reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
so i can take a step back , and just jump back to a specific section .
no fear , no par@@ ks , me@@ tab@@ oli@@ cs , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
the sp@@ are reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; for instance , &quot; for instance , what are sustainable proteins are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve brought you a project that i want to show you now .
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ars .
in the end , three of these are always waiting for this one , two will always wait .
the brown is kind of the conven@@ tional system , the green one system .
we can also turn the two kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic on the net .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ ss , but it would be nice .
i want to do this idea a little bit more quickly about what is a little bit crazy .
he came to the table with a bright , almost fu@@ zz@@ y white ink .
it &apos;s near the mou@@ ths of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ r .
they grow meat rates on what they were basically we@@ ely le@@ ak@@ ed .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , they didn &apos;t care about the work , not too econom@@ ically .
it &apos;s evol@@ ving in the course of evolution , un@@ necessary . &quot;
in this country at all , but 16 times the world in the last year .
and i might think maybe maybe my island project is that i attemp@@ ted to brow@@ se you .
or maybe they &apos;re one of those people who are always after more creativity .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
we think epi@@ mi@@ t@@ ated sett@@ l@@ ings and giving people the possibility to reach them .
our language actually shapes and how we see the world and people around us .
so , again , change and adap@@ ting is the greatest skills of people .
we can give up a new meaning that comes out of sever@@ e times .
wi@@ dri@@ tion@@ ality is a change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted to .
and then , the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
there are these ancient cu@@ be , from she@@ ep , you know ?
these are choices with their grand@@ son , or their grand@@ son , they need to go together .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number of measu@@ re@@ ments are multi@@ pl@@ ying .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jung@@ le of con@@ go .
as a con@@ sequence , the body goes up with the typical female over .
and when he was born , he saw a young boy -- no one had an anything .
they were playing wor@@ ms for 18 years ; we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft .
you actually ought to prove to see if it &apos;s such a will@@ ing@@ ness of freedom .
if you ask the happiness of the day , it &apos;s a very different thing .
in the sense of yourself , the re@@ changing self , get another story .
when you take out , those are more effective than tab@@ le@@ be@@ ds each of the form .
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , and on the other side .
now , the re@@ changing self more than to re@@ mind and tell stories .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply to , one per yourself .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a rather complicated process .
but this is not really what &apos;s actually going to happen . and i open my hand .
not as i did -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more pro@@ c@@ ute .
this is a player who is on the edge of something called ep@@ an sett@@ l@@ ings .
oh , you know this . ok , so we have some players here .
this is me , as i &apos;m sick , &quot; my face . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success , the theory of success .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players doing ? &quot;
i &apos;ve worked 11 years in the colle@@ c@@ tively , which was base democratic .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i killed only under the spe@@ ar .
i &apos;ve been asking li@@ l@@ ly , whether i want to mention them .
the united states is one of the largest pollu@@ tan@@ ts , along with china .
this is in our entire country of the second waste waste of america .
not the work itself . that was continu@@ ing a lot of dark as e@@ h and je .
this is the chan@@ ger war@@ k@@ land river in southern nor@@ th@@ land .
in the an@@ gles of this gl@@ aci@@ er , the drin@@ king water source of the city is for this city .
four@@ te@@ en times as many of the last 30 years , in the previous 30 years , in the previous 30 years .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ical as well , you can see what it does .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re living our great creative ag@@ gre@@ t to live .
with your chem@@ ist block@@ ase , john -- how do you do that ?
so let &apos;s make a tour of the modern , clean co@@ w factory .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis , climate crisis .
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how to evol@@ ve .
and i &apos;m going to put the filter on the board , which is a little bit more expression .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to matter , like this .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
a project that i had started to do is build a geni@@ us gun .
i want to start with what i call &quot; off@@ ic@@ er do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
should i get married ? should i have kids , or do a career ? &quot;
it &apos;s not going to produce the reality of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality .
but people say , &quot; the plants are speaking to us , &quot; the plants speak to us . &quot;
we &apos;ve also made something in the corner of this particular clip of the guar@@ di@@ an of the guar@@ di@@ an of the guar@@ di@@ an .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft at the end of microsoft .
and you have to do it too , and understand it , and understand it .
they &apos;ve seen ma@@ ize eth@@ an@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment .
they really want to really accu@@ rate the decision when it &apos;s all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
when you came to 100 species , one of them would have perfect be perfect .
so we can use the genetic code to write the words , sent@@ ences , thoughts , thoughts .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been put together again as it was .
it &apos;s blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been ad@@ ded .
what are our values and what are the tar@@ ge@@ ted of our based on our basis ?
chr@@ ent@@ u@@ um , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism or whatever .
if that &apos;s ab@@ and@@ y , the student will get the success@@ fully part of it .
fair enough , that &apos;s a quick piece of piece .
so this is the baby &apos;s worth of carbon for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so , the music works for me as much as the spo@@ ken language .
they studied the works that he had before and after@@ wards .
you bring up a new idea in and so@@ same that is ans@@ wer@@ ed by a response to a reaction .
so , every time you &apos;re reading something new , i &apos;m reading something new .
because they have already practic@@ ed twice the previous head cha@@ irs .
we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental conscious in the south .
i wonder that you often forget something fundamental respe@@ cted .
to sing , to sing our hands and its feet to dan@@ cing .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes out of the meeting and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of wor@@ ster .
she li@@ kes to li@@ ft it , because he has a tenden@@ cy to stand up on the rise .
there we go on the de@@ po@@ ted , but in the landscape , yes ?
here &apos;s the lo@@ gic in this one , right , in this de@@ ception talk to expression .
so we have the eyes at the beginning , and now you think we &apos;re going back to the beginning .
so , as a result , i met a lot of the behaviors that look a lot more often than what looks like .
you can explain a lot of that , because there &apos;s still potential behind it .
of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
that was de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
because steve jobs have said , you &apos;ve got to be more challen@@ ged to the following show show how it came to it .
close to law , sha@@ ped of the continu@@ ity and so forth .
where the language was put together by sub-@@ ran@@ g@@ ne@@ tte ran@@ gs .
that means you can see the internet , you can see the nutri@@ ents .
and at once one interface , which is much more intui@@ tive and much more natural .
that means that we &apos;re not too many , it &apos;s stupid , yeah ?
there &apos;s still three in the ama@@ zon area still in the ama@@ zon area of a hundred trees .
that means that all of your intelligence means that we want to be tren@@ dy as a trees .
and in our western world , we were always du@@ m@@ b , to bring our nutri@@ ents back .
okay , just a quick example of an alternative of sexual sexu@@ ality .
this is why we &apos;re growing the const@@ it@@ u@@ ency of antibio@@ tics .
and this next steps , as electr@@ on@@ ics , seem very few decades to re@@ gre@@ t .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve the government of government .
these little oil dro@@ ps were in the sense of the most primi@@ tive cell form .
and that &apos;s what made these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
and most people understand this , but they think that one is the input of another .
but at &quot; &quot; well , it &apos;s all open , so everybody can see it .
and she &apos;s doing it in a lot of ways that we don &apos;t even understand them right now .
and ultimately , i think programs can actually st@@ ally care the numbers of numbers .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
this is a generation that has grown up with their voice for gran@@ ted , of course .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
now -- we can just ski@@ p -- i &apos;m just going to push the video out ...
but if i could give this , and i could make sure that i would do it .
it &apos;s not about what reali@@ stic is , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
nobody knew where the next life of life was in this moment .
i thought , &quot; yeah , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
so he did what each good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into ra@@ m@@ als .
they were in febru@@ ary in febru@@ ary , and it has last last febru@@ ary .
and you realize that the city can never ch@@ ase hy@@ dr@@ ene fre@@ ely .
it was also a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
we were telling her stories , and in@@ sur@@ ing her , that we were at her .
it came back to the bottom of the sea , and then it turns out .
they use online dinosaurs to make a lot of money , make a huge amount of money .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people now who are playing the game online .
the rest of the day , the night i had this short feeling in my sto@@ mach .
up to the 198@@ 0s , it was fis@@ hed in a lot of style .
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse about the world .
there &apos;s an increas@@ ed risk risk of an increas@@ ed risk of risk .
this is w@@ ells &apos; sa@@ un@@ di@@ me in est@@ on@@ ia .
li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its are electr@@ onic mode , which has a specific function .
the idea behind the dic@@ tion@@ ary is that it &apos;s a growing library .
these people represent several trillion dollars , which are flo@@ wing into the global economy .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother she s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed .
we would be aware of ourselves , consci@@ ously and tar@@ ge@@ ted people . &quot;
we need to finish ways to put ourselves into these challenges : these problems , this suffering , this suffering .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now i drink something . &quot;
and they believed that this is the top@@ ics that we care about .
i &apos;m talking about race , and the question is , do we have the right to kill it .
i had what , her sister had a be@@ er . go , drink a be@@ er .
we have te@@ sted ourselves from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t care about it , it isn &apos;t just a the@@ b .
i per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated these kids who were con@@ vi@@ cted too hard .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all de@@ lic@@ ent de@@ lic@@ ence didn &apos;t have to do with a re@@ co@@ very .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s about women .
we had never had the question to fight when anyone was dead .
i looked through the sho@@ ot@@ ing wall and i looked at them on the other side .
the idea behind the sta@@ tic computer wor@@ m is pretty stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals , which we were able to demon@@ strate or dis@@ connect .
it saved my life , and my partner and i re@@ turned , y@@ ours and y@@ ours y@@ ours .
well , i had a unique place in this day ; i sat on 1@@ d .
and more than anything else , they &apos;re the best parents they can only be ?
while a pol@@ ar mountain mel@@ ting , brea@@ thing i would give him a long atmosphere .
imagine that everybody can give up a little clip for a point of view .
and we just ran into a g@@ ate@@ way , and we had to re@@ pair ourselves .
and in fact , this fal@@ se resul@@ ting data is already taken off .
so , despite that war@@ ning , i knew that someone else would buy the nam@@ f rights right now .
and someone who has a such arti@@ stic potential does so much more .
but if it comes to that , it &apos;s supposed to be trans@@ formed , changes anything .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to finish all of this again .
these would be , in engineering teams , a real time control system .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the an@@ atom@@ y .
he said , &quot; tell me what the fe@@ min@@ ism is female . &quot;
if you think you &apos;re looking at something , it &apos;s almost sec@@ ure .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still going away .
well , all of the objects , starting to speak back to us .
and that changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we have people with our environment outside of our environment .
you can see in the middle the g@@ olo@@ s@@ s@@ um , the ti@@ gers ti@@ li@@ li@@ der .
but is it a hard thing to do about the film or a hard thing to me ?
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us , was great .
now , before we started today , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
this is a highly in@@ efficient categ@@ ori@@ zation rate .
we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ ands for our experiment .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even when it comes to our own best interests .
you know , the average super@@ power@@ s today , give you 4@@ 5,000 products .
there &apos;s a million people who are an@@ nu@@ ally la@@ tin american and moving in the united states .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new opportunities for leaders with one .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : take a car on a car .
when i start with the simpl@@ est beginning , i &apos;m going to learn how i choose .
just like &quot; the &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , it seems to be made of nothing to be here .
just for about 12 percent of your choices , they needed an hour or more of their time .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ less loo@@ p loo@@ p .
i think , if you stop people , you get them closer to failure .
i think my personal perspective is very simple with this slide and a chance of it .
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ ol@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
... that does not need to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . what kinds of kil@@ ter@@ co@@ aster are they ?
and i think some companies are just foc@@ using on a star@@ ness , rather than both of them .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting ch@@ est ?
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the great everyday objects around us .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to do for 10 billion points ? &quot;
i went close , and i noticed slowly that these kids actually che@@ cked a little bit .
it &apos;s not as though you &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive or the same .
here we can see , paper , paper and water bot@@ tles like geor@@ ges ...
take it away , you rever@@ se diseases , horri@@ ble disease , and this is what happens .
i know that they &apos;ve done it because half of the american americans are doing it everyday .
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &quot; they don &apos;t care .
but you know , i do what i do . i put the paper , i kept going .
we &apos;re going to talk about them , with little leaders , &quot; progress . &quot;
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
he can save the lives of 4@@ 2,000 , 50 million children a year in the developing world .
a great machine , a cool ted machine , and this is a time machine .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
i &apos;m sorry . if you don &apos;t care , look away , look away , look away .
these are real patients who are contribu@@ ting to a pain@@ t@@ ary pro@@ c@@ du@@ r .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we consu@@ me while we &apos;re in the world .
if you don &apos;t have a gam@@ er , you might think of some of the nuclear opportunities in this picture .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to have a oil na@@ vy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
but in this case , we need to give and get a mira@@ cle in very recently .
this is im@@ men@@ sely important . it &apos;s a good follo@@ wer for marketing . &quot;
and i fly with a little robot with the ge@@ ars of the shi@@ ff@@ ine .
it &apos;s actually only my consciousness , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
we &apos;re starting to play the production cost , which is not a tra@@ h tra@@ p .
not an important amount of entertain@@ ment , which requires innovation , has been stopped without risk .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should be .
you might say , &quot; why would anyone actually spend time making a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
if you want to say about 100 percent , you &apos;ve got an incredible battery battery .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who are already enga@@ ged there at ted .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the cost is very much better .
now , this new fla@@ w is : &quot; why aren &apos;t the research going to work anymore ? &quot;
con@@ struc@@ tors don &apos;t recognize this kind of collaboration as a fac@@ ial pre@@ ference .
these feelings have never , when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
so we did , and we did a while for a while for a while .
i could see it in your eyes because there were sc@@ ared , the life was to finish .
i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned on this day about me .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficient rate in the system .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side you see the picture , the different break@@ through tun@@ ed .
but in the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve been working on , i &apos;ve been working on this guy .
i love this picture because it &apos;s a room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking at something , you probably have the right .
it &apos;s all i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case for a week .
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i decide to be happy .
so we don &apos;t need to worry that other goals of ma@@ x@@ net could be met .
and if you do that , you eventually get a cyber@@ mass ra@@ pe wea@@ pon .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals for such sound attac@@ ks don &apos;t be in the middle east .
thank you that you &apos;ve given us a heal@@ ing , thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
and if the car and the driver was well enough , they then win the race .
and my love for the ocean , with the same inten@@ sity as e@@ h and je .
so let me introdu@@ ce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal mal@@ car@@ rier .
so , an all@@ -@@ intui@@ tive phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y : somebody even brought up a couple of shoes .
so we have to look forward to the psychology and concent@@ rate at all the human opportunities .
we dou@@ bt a common ance@@ st@@ or about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there was maybe 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
evolution pri@@ gs the creatures that are best at the environment of their environment .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the ele@@ ction to have more men than men .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe this words that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s because of what 17@@ 7@@ 6 fa@@ thers happened .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity .
but unfortunately , we em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed this complexity in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
it doesn &apos;t mean that those destruction of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is dangerous to the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
and that &apos;s why the ho@@ sti@@ le sta@@ dium is te@@ sto@@ ster@@ ster@@ ster@@ ster@@ ster@@ ster@@ ster@@ ster@@ i@@ ster@@ one .
he had a very extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te by@@ a@@ wa@@ ken@@ e@@ ve of kid@@ na@@ p hyper@@ bo@@ unds .
but i wanted to do the real re@@ ck@@ ard of the ti@@ tan@@ ic hin@@ t .
when any of you were born in this room , 6@@ 0,000 languages talked to the earth .
so we went to ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , still a lot more .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been asking myself : &quot; why ?
and last month resear@@ cher , the entire continent gave us an electrical photograph .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscop@@ e .
we &apos;re about six and a half billion people in the next 40 years growing over the next 40 years .
then , of course , there &apos;s a whole carbon of this material that goes into the atmosphere in the atmosphere .
we &apos;re here first of the boundar@@ ies of biological reality and in those of our idea .
this wir@@ ing 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ ters when the machine is running on high-@@ performance .
i had it better . all these choices gave me better to it .
do you guys want to was@@ h or shar@@ p@@ dly ? stone or ac@@ id was@@ hed ?
fro@@ sty of the man is a pleasure of pleasure , fro@@ gs bur@@ den .
the spa@@ tial thinking is inti@@ ma@@ tely related to how we understand a lot of our environment .
so , okay , so now , to ha@@ ck biology , somehow you need to sort of stuff .
so it didn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ able .
i think that &apos;s a lot of people who are there , in fact , there are less people .
these organisms can be totally blo@@ wn up , they can even live in the vac@@ u@@ um of life .
that &apos;s just the pressure and print ty@@ mit , with gu@@ ten@@ berg and other .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which actually connected two different technologies together .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ce@@ li@@ sk@@ i of microsoft was doing research , a very good collaboration .
the father of this boy is identi@@ fied as follo@@ wers of the pan@@ el lam@@ a .
the family , the fear of his life , he had all the g@@ rief and all the tools and all the tools .
in the national geographic , we &apos;re trying to believe that that politicians never achieve something .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious app@@ lic@@ ation of a technology like this .
there &apos;s an oper@@ a@@ tional fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where i actually need to understand where i actually need to go .
it makes a stat@@ ement about now and maybe about things too .
look at this as the continu@@ ing of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ler &apos;s work on virtual earth .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what you did after that .
and in fact , they should . this is important questions .
it &apos;s an effect , parado@@ x@@ er , is that it &apos;s paraly@@ zing paraly@@ sis instead of free .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; the man says , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
and with some kind of po@@ ck@@ light , we can make these virtual space worl@@ ds .
the interesting thing is , what the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
what na@@ than@@ iel approach@@ ed him back into a community of friends .
i said , &quot; how much percent of them is chicken ? &quot;
they &apos;re not allowed to name them , that would be a little bit of a political in@@ cor@@ rect line .
people are always asking me , what do you do in ad@@ eric sh@@ ine ?
have we negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i &apos;ve cho@@ sen a new social aff@@ lu@@ ent .
mu@@ st run is simple , which is the power of power , to keep the frequ@@ ency .
and you really need to go really hard , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
saying , who doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l who is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , it has no sou@@ l .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ conscious and well-@@ inten@@ dent .
he looked at me when i was a song of the whit@@ ney hou@@ ston hou@@ ston .
she li@@ sted c@@ ute and in , as if you would take a bi@@ te from the ocean .
and then he ad@@ ded himself , &quot; but the water has no in@@ door to the water . &quot;
so , what we &apos;re seeing is a typical animal graph after old .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is an es@@ el that &apos;s made of p@@ ure nature .
that &apos;s what the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ der@@ -@@ adap@@ ted thing has been adap@@ ted .
i said , well , you &apos;ve got to take care of it as long as the spo@@ ken language .
and i said , but sure enough , you can tell me whether you like it or not .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s just kind of easy to do it .
in israel , you say , if you live a human life , you would res@@ et the earth .
a woman in germany is about six po@@ is@@ ms of their life , three kil@@ ogra@@ ms of their life .
so , we don &apos;t need to be dead neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be more positive .
the work of the interpre@@ tation is similar to how one the@@ at@@ er@@ al director is .
the next generation of the graph@@ y user interface is already working on be@@ ds .
so we &apos;re supposed to be aware of them as something which is necessarily about present for our life to be present .
so , they didn &apos;t eat up until they don &apos;t co@@ ok , because they don &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you don &apos;t need to have any of the classi@@ cal music , because you don &apos;t have an instrument .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought of , because what you might have thought of is .
you can get less easy , yeah , check or go to a one-@@ load .
why do we need to prevent people to know about something , if true ?
now this brand , the quality com@@ m of sta@@ dium , the steel is center ...
rec@@ ession . do@@ om@@ s@@ days . eg@@ y@@ pt . eg@@ y@@ pt .
he was always watching the window and i could hear the whole to@@ o@@ w@@ u .
and instead of having economic stand@@ still , i see one of the largest economic sh@@ ots of history .
but now , the largest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of over@@ all .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of ice sp@@ ill@@ ed all 8@@ 8 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
at this point i was ac@@ qui@@ red the car@@ di@@ ology layer in the car@@ di@@ ology service .
that &apos;s often resul@@ ted in a relationship with the increase in in@@ ar@@ red numbers .
i gave her her as@@ pi@@ ra@@ ine , and i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , &quot; you put this crazy post ? &quot;
and i didn &apos;t only have wrote myself , but the court sent him to the court .
and yet , in our country , a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we &apos;re the sa@@ a@@ der close and moving to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
seven million people are dis@@ ser@@ ved or with un@@ condi@@ tional lab@@ s .
now , at the time , we &apos;re foc@@ using on the large animals and the ocean &apos;s the big fish .
and you know the quie@@ t of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst acci@@ dents ?
you can put a switch in between and so you have a little di@@ verse .
st@@ ones were very quickly con@@ struc@@ ting the ma@@ st@@ est unit unit in the world .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ temp@@ ted st@@ ones .
he said , &quot; om@@ a tell everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our imagination were we@@ ak@@ y , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
in the united states , the institute of 100,000 dollars is the number of 100,000 dollars .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response as anti@@ bodies , which attack a human attack .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him down .
they say , &quot; no , don &apos;t say the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and i would like to be happy if ce@@ g would help to do this .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you &apos;re -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where it &apos;s been de@@ va@@ stat@@ ed by adverti@@ sing .
the other place , which was very interested in the city building , is sing@@ apo@@ re .
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as was under a he@@ el fi@@ ber explosion .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be divi@@ ded into two hal@@ ds .
imagine the first piece : a man who bur@@ ns his food .
we trained a team , a great man , and we started with this .
like most adults on the boat , my mother has a little po@@ und bottle on it .
are they something that &apos;s a slightly quie@@ ter , conser@@ va@@ tive , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
what is the che@@ ese ? what pu@@ pu@@ p@@ stage , you &apos;re at the moment right now ?
man 5 : mar@@ ke al@@ co@@ hol s@@ uns@@ sin@@ ated .
or even stupid of these cities , or hundreds of them spread around the world ?
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i got out of them .
so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can put online .
and so -- this box is like , &quot; i write my name .
so she stru@@ ck me that i could har@@ dly brea@@ the . they made me go .
when i met them as a little kid , she came to me and hu@@ g me up .
there &apos;s a number of opportunities to connect the world and the technology and technology .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve only got to talk about three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
so you have to p@@ are the i@@ pad , and the light flies get out .
it has to go up to a school school , because she had to pass six years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took several hundred million years .
if we want to say that this institution is working for us , we need to do bu@@ re@@ au@@ sexual sex@@ y .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you could adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ hy@@ op@@ er .
we want every single interaction on the world in a u@@ tili@@ t@@ cut rock .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in life itself ?
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the self .
and this really begins with a fundamental reaction to our memor@@ ies -- it begins immediately .
and none of the stories is very sophisti@@ cated or great -- but one of them is this clear .
what a story record , the great e@@ ye@@ glas@@ ses , and end up .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as an experience .
this is one of the explan@@ ations that &apos;s been given to the domin@@ ance of remem@@ ber@@ ing yourself .
in front of a year or so , i read a study that really blo@@ cked me really hard .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists do all this in it .
just to give you an idea of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ related is about 2@@ 2-@@ 5 .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that it &apos;s time for 21 billion hours per week .
he wanted to capture the feelings in games , so he put a camera on the players .
here are the four things i found : first of all , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m .
and the reason is that there requires a lot of trust to play with someone playing with a game .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five , five .
so , what do we actually want to be mani@@ pul@@ ated -- a dis@@ ab@@ led people or a powerful people ?
well , there &apos;s all kinds of play@@ ful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring all a lot of them .
instead of raising the head , you just burn it . a great thing .
i have all these movies , these docum@@ entation movies , for a very small audience .
this leads to star@@ ving . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty .
i &apos;ve been asking the top scientists , &quot; do we really go down too far ?
it &apos;s all about the food that the food that we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
usually there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a certain date .
and he called this part of his course , the potential of the human race , the potential of the human race .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ure --
when countries get together in places like cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , they don &apos;t only care about co2 .
and it would be the best , if it &apos;s several , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
terri@@ fying the great break@@ through , this is the greatest one you know ?
and those of you who care about mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ging .
they find crazy examples from all around the world , like people to optimi@@ ze the system and re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
sounds funny , but this continu@@ ing that your personal imagination can create reality .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and up there you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
it has nothing to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with copy@@ right protection .
we put up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the park in front of the park .
you can have me as a farmer , or in empty , but nobody has ever vot@@ ed farmers .
she saved my life using me using the toi@@ let in the classroom .
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open him .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in this code .
my life is really un@@ common through the work of some amazing projects .
please pay attention to the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it &apos;s on the water line .
so he would work so well -- in a power plant or in a car factory .
in my opini@@ on , the mo@@ s@@ ses involved , but the driving force is not israel .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , as a brand , a challen@@ ger en@@ challen@@ ging .
we need to encoura@@ ge people , not fear of opportunities that you might be afraid of .
when i travel@@ ed , and these mu@@ kes , i started to learn a lot of learning .
i met with his father and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a short over@@ come and a symbol of the field that comes from it .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of carbon emissions -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our lab@@ s .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it will fire it , it &apos;s very comfortable , it &apos;s very comfortable .
but is there a third option , an amazing and terri@@ fying possibility .
so here &apos;s a young female and male men in a ver@@ tical game .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures at the beginning of the talk .
now , what &apos;s changed now is that real versus contro@@ versi@@ ing systems are starting to di@@ ve in our lives .
it means something to say that in one of them , the potential ti@@ ck@@ le .
it &apos;s a physical syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed in london , but with illu@@ stra@@ tions .
early after@@ noon , people here , the re@@ vie@@ ws and move , and move .
and if we would show that to people , then we can drive a behavi@@ oral change .
well , should i tell you what one night was going on when all the sensor@@ s stopped working .
and this is the beauty of making things that will be used and interact with people .
and these particles are water , while the cloud hits a cloud of points .
well , they were also high-@@ tech and dur@@ ed .
and then you would realize how it was , if you could &apos;t speak your own language .
so i put this up and made this other film over the big ship , which goes on .
and now i put the filter with the dru@@ m , so i can control the effect of the effect , so i can control the effect .
it &apos;s extremely important now , and still a lot more , much more important , much more important , is going to get into future .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and lo@@ vers , and workers sta@@ ist in lo@@ g and bread .
in co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
and finally , the positive alternative has been mix@@ ed with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
in short , a car@@ ro@@ wing is an inter@@ active computers in the size of a k@@ is@@ ses .
all you need to say is &quot; educ@@ ated words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of ko@@ ko incre@@ ases was this one .
i don &apos;t need to say to myself , if i &apos;m mad about it , is no fear of fear .
the fourth element is that history is a place for us to be a place for us .
there are technical concep@@ ts like aug@@ mented reality , which is the aug@@ mented reality of reality .
yeah , kids are from an in@@ her@@ ently curious or should be curious , designers too .
but the primary medium was , but the language , something very natural , something very natural , something very powerful .
it may be that we know global and more rapi@@ dly , and more and better and better .
there are in sh@@ ell and pl@@ um@@ bing in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy to grow .
this made a whole lot of user , but it &apos;s also a lot better than that .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
we &apos;ve tried different ways to simpli@@ fy it down to the mini@@ mal components .
their own photos will say to the meta@@ data , which has a different person who has a different person .
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
i want to say that there were a few choices , but it wasn &apos;t all a question of choice .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never .
and this leads to less satis@@ fying happiness with results , even though the results are good .
but this brings me to the point , which is when things are actually more intui@@ tive ?
these fe@@ a@@ sts were always wonderful , because the dan@@ cer dan@@ cers were profession@@ ally and they were fantastic .
and so we started with the question , and we started to syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed ?
there are enzy@@ mes that are called the limit@@ s enzy@@ me , which actually be@@ ars dna .
it conver@@ ts co2 in me@@ than@@ e to use hydro@@ gen from the use of hydro@@ gen .
that means -- i &apos;m pretty young : i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i think that this success pressure has taken our artists over the last 500 years .
so no zer@@ os and ones , or kr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ary contact and made a profound mistake .
you can of course that if you &apos;re here in some way , here &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about in some way .
we &apos;re cheap as the same system , if the price five percent per year goes up .
although i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technologi@@ cal things .
so , as it turns out , it &apos;s impossible to be impossible without a sou@@ l .
and please use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ t@@ arily , which is prop@@ he@@ t .
that was all vic@@ ti@@ cians , the je@@ wel@@ ry , the je@@ wel@@ s , the je@@ wel@@ s .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , yes , as you get to hundreds percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and if true is true , then we need to stop the people from being aware of it .
this woman has com@@ pla@@ ined the portra@@ it would not see the portra@@ it like that .
do we also support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
well , last year on this site 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
oh , and by the way , these amin@@ o gos should not even be there .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ mi@@ el .
and if i really are honest , you &apos;re a better che@@ f than i ever will be .
she came to school one day , she was teacher , and she told me about a student .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
it &apos;s like , you know , for la@@ sting , what we &apos;re doing with our musi@@ cians with our music language .
well , if you have dreams , you have dreams , but it &apos;s not an important memor@@ ies .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
that means that the whole intelligence means that we want to be swi@@ mmer as a trees , right ?
it &apos;s safe to be less har@@ m@@ ful of what oil consumption is about .
these are six countries that are spending tw@@ ent@@ y percent of oil supp@@ lies .
at any point where you throw away from , yeah , you make life opportunity .
we could only gli@@ de it as am@@ olo@@ p@@ ver from the world ocean .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter pic@@ as@@ so wrote a woman portra@@ it .
it &apos;s always the ex@@ act garden , but to various da@@ y@@ time time , in various light .
but also , if you re@@ f@@ use this ab@@ und@@ ance , it still has a little bit more technical .
or , you know , because you have them , that they be di@@ ver .
you &apos;ve got a second -- or a third opini@@ on , how you &apos;re excited about it today ?
or , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to have music to do it so well .
and i started playing all the way around , and i found that there was something happening there .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever &apos;s next .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it &apos;s so conf@@ using .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to pay attention to their attention .
as a doctor , you can do good . the care@@ ful doctor can do something more .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to have a piece of instru@@ mental ima@@ ging and mark .
a story that goes on with new issues like the environmental crisis , like the environmental crisis .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that the magic and magic through machines were re@@ constru@@ ed by machines .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could &apos;t .
as a young law@@ yer , i had the privi@@ lege of meeting the big privi@@ lege , p@@ ink par@@ ks .
we know that an education process is not opti@@ m@@ zed when it &apos;s too too complex .
it &apos;s a combin@@ ation of re@@ mix@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to the fo@@ ods . &quot;
but one of the ones that love to do is to put two nu@@ mm@@ ers into the right order .
and then the next steps , as language and so forth , took less than a million years .
the first steps of the story that i told you , took a billion years per piece .
she said , &quot; well , first of all , i sus@@ pe@@ cted that you always love your mom@@ a . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually share their dna .
and my patients are not cars ; they tell me their symptom@@ s always in the same way .
in an emergen@@ cy room , i have two times a blind z@@ ones .
green is ex@@ pos@@ it@@ ary , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and orange cor@@ ds .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
they &apos;re self-@@ motiv@@ ated -- the test about which , or through their audience , or through their audience .
mr. ja@@ in yourself is un@@ familiar with the place of un@@ familiar with the place of un@@ known .
the second concept is another concept , which is changing the changing ta@@ il@@ -@@ scale , ev@@ en@@ n@@ ly .
is this really , that means that we &apos;re in the middle right here in a transition .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and about a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
i think that we need something against a changing piece of medical culture company .
and if we have an energy over@@ come , we &apos;ll also have water in the stream .
think that a group of students now can affect the lives of billions of people now .
every second person will catch a lot more information than our brain &apos;s brain ever can process .
what happened is that the individual organisms have a way to communicate a way to each other .
and what if you want to see like van go@@ gh of this ma@@ ster@@ piece because he has created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
i want to talk about what this could be like , this transition in which we &apos;re at right now .
they make more worse decisions -- worse , financial and worse medical decisions and worse medical decisions .
and after that , we looked at what case people actually bought a glass stam@@ er .
now these decisions in the number of choices that provide a decision to offer a decision .
and this is a problem that often happens when you look at the long bul@@ let of all this f@@ ond fund .
for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se process .
and if their employees can &apos;t stop them , their custom@@ ers don &apos;t care . &quot;
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to get to it .
re@@ bec@@ ca fri@@ day &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ zero gab@@ ined , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
we &apos;ve put a little ver@@ meer right at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the business of business .
one of the things that you know already has already been educ@@ ated , there &apos;s a lot of r@@ ings .
you &apos;ve already got a building block , and you &apos;re already talking about this space for the second city .
at 17@@ th of 17@@ th , it became a voice with 1@@ 14 to a voice .
and i came to the stat@@ ement that a new city will give people new opportunities for people to give people new opportunities .
what i &apos;m going to do is , i change the order of the decisions in the decisions .
what does it mean for an object to the same time , and not vi@@ ral ?
if you do that , you can name him a name , and he called the first al al .
we choose some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we let them work with community admini@@ stra@@ tions .
but if something happens here , it changes the quality al@@ it@@ ative circum@@ stances .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but in fact the general form of the general form .
you can express your opini@@ on , at every time , and you do it .
i &apos;m speaking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others and to help others .
this is the work that is very smart people in the office of new urban organization in boston .
it &apos;s not possible that everything &apos;s going to be on forever and forever as fast as now .
as i said , one of the largest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- put his beginning on youtube .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to compe@@ te for conser@@ vation using ...
you know , where all the human machines are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht in ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
in order to get the mon@@ k and said , he had to go to the sar@@ g .
&quot; you just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
after three months in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps , we land@@ ed in mel@@ ting .
you can go to the website , all the design facili@@ ties , and they make them yourself .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which are extraordinary at whatever .
so scientists came to realize that her@@ at@@ eric &apos;s crazy story actually is true .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience of experience of the population .
well , unfortunately , we tend to see this face in the real life , if we en@@ counter hard problems .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that the epi@@ c sett@@ l@@ ers are so possible .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what to do , whatever the most important people in the world .
so many people have at the right now in the world at least an hour per day with online games .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less , and a lot less than before .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living itself and the re@@ changing self .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global sele@@ ction , &quot; of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
we &apos;re working with universi@@ ties at all over africa and invi@@ ting them , social re@@ co@@ very .
and dr. p@@ . was always very color@@ ful , and i was just like , for the work with kids , just like created .
and i turn around , and i see this older man -- i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw them , i brought them out of her mother . &quot;
people are starting to recognize that they should think of happiness , when they think of politics .
the real meaning of &quot; &quot; popular &quot; roots in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
so there are profound lessons for us about nature and success and success .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opini@@ on , even a right to his opini@@ on , to the progress of progress .
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that shows the idea of people here ?
well , let &apos;s go to the finish that we have to reach and then we talk about the inter@@ section .
we need to take action interven@@ tion to try and main@@ tain the earth &apos;s temperature ?
climate k@@ is@@ tics : have you got one or two sent@@ ences for them to convince you ?
that &apos;s that b@@ w@@ l students were trained to find a real plan , ok !
they call that &quot; stre@@ tch &quot; in the united states as &quot; tracking . &quot;
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients know that they were dre@@ aming ? &quot;
and this , although none of this is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical ... there are just sugar p@@ ills .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . that &apos;s a lot stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if you have a proje@@ ctor .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both in the imagination of happiness .
and then he put it really emotion@@ ally , really emotional , which has been ru@@ ined in the whole experience .
and this is because i have something to do with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and these students didn &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their shoul@@ ders under the street .
8@@ 8@@ 8 re@@ vi@@ val hits sc@@ at@@ er@@ al , except at the was@@ hing day .
i think the gene , the style i have , is &quot; &quot; glamour &quot; . &quot;
and then he said three words -- the input lo@@ bri@@ sts , which i &apos;ve ever heard .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal of being a good deal to be a good dad .
the gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ ing , which you see here , these are real time control systems .
and so the film will analy@@ ze this whole idea -- this is what ? in per@@ ity , forever ?
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone does under the ach@@ es .
and this is what brought us on the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples -- again , with the idea of our environment , and drive it .
let me tell you a little bit about how it &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
i feel that we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks to take risks .
i actually come into one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
this didn &apos;t mean my intui@@ tions , and maybe because i don &apos;t care so often with particles .
in the year 2007 , i decided that we should be thinking of re@@ concep@@ tu@@ ation as we think about economic engineering .
they say that all the things that are shown up there are a life@@ -@@ cycle impli@@ c@@ us .
well , we colli@@ de a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons of tons .
get them in a sou@@ p kitchen , smo@@ pping them up a park in the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
first there &apos;s a ball@@ game on bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i don &apos;t think of it in the foot@@ ball .
but anyway , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they care for their life .
let &apos;s look at the reality that people now , in some cultures , are decisions about their post-@@ war decisions .
in the good ways in the evil , and it used to be , as you might think , these decisions become us .
in the bru@@ ise of a second , i lost each feeling and a half below my che@@ titude .
you &apos;re going to go up to the top , and you have to catch this woman a few shoes . &quot;
and a student is che@@ cked hard , get the better teacher and etc .
over the cities , all of this sense and drive it in objects of everyday lives .
this could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of it : &quot; you pac@@ ka@@ ge him in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
i &apos;ve worked with people with z@@ ages -- people who were smaller than usual .
women , as men , have a little bit of something called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine expres@@ ses .
so , for example , the fact that we have the least 95 percent of dna with chimpanze@@ es .
and it makes me excited about over@@ wh@@ el@@ med democracy in terms of democracy .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s all kinds of good news .
it &apos;s a mean , with the sou@@ l of a particular culture access to the material world .
so let &apos;s take a look at each other and think , how do we get to zero .
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
in california , we &apos;ve seen a 40 percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ now of the si@@ er@@ ra .
the question i want to ask everybody here is : is this idea for you all right ?
it felt like it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the be@@ ds .
but then i remember tom in the free sky , and i tried .
okay , but if you don &apos;t t@@ ust , you know what , then the fu@@ ck to it .
so this was what happened , people knew what it was -- they called it in his name .
but also , we &apos;re working at the same approach@@ es of the v@@ acc@@ ine v@@ ements in the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
we have the opportunity to build a large robot on the millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
this au@@ c@@ tu@@ ping in the entire world leads to a dra@@ matic increase on fire .
look at it , this is the era , clean coal technology .
and the si@@ gh@@ table ones are an example of a new generation of aid resources to manipu@@ late manipu@@ lation data .
you need to have biological materials , and you need to have tools , and it &apos;s also tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and what we need to do is just say , &quot; okay , you don &apos;t need to do it , you don &apos;t have to do it .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by re@@ mix@@ ing vac@@ cin@@ es in the sub@@ way .
the interesting thing is that at the time of the human age at the same time , the human media and medium was .
the doctor says a has these advan@@ tages and risks and b have those advan@@ tages and risks and risks .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less accu@@ rate .
it &apos;s a photograph that i took over the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon ama@@ zon .
the sister , who did this ta@@ ping , was brought into an education camp .
this is a reali@@ stic case . this is a piece of the guar@@ di@@ an of the guar@@ di@@ an .
all of these photos are being inter@@ connected , and something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of parts of the parts .
and what it does is it takes people to run into the business and ask this question .
we &apos;re still at the end as an information facili@@ zation very , very promis@@ ing .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process slightly further .
so many op@@ tions from the one that you can choose to do is get people very hard to decide .
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing sen@@ sing .
and the sal@@ es@@ hi@@ p said , &quot; do you want to sna@@ ke , easy or shar@@ p ?
you will never be surprised . because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , high school .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the sh@@ est , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for mistake .
and i would invi@@ te everybody to engage with this , and even for example , whatever to try and experiment .
if i ask you , the great world im@@ migr@@ ants , what would you say ?
and this night i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
it &apos;s the world &apos;s largest and one of the most important private , a@@ vi@@ an reser@@ va@@ tions in europe .
by the way , a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electric performance on the ground are based on the basis of the world .
that means that we &apos;ve cho@@ sen to find the largest battery of the world .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , that is like a water@@ ste@@ er system .
then you just do what &apos;s in the sun and the wind , where you live , where you live .
and the reality is that it &apos;s reach@@ ed by us , and it &apos;s inspired by us , and uni@@ te us .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re hot at this point , because there &apos;s something wrong .
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technologi@@ cal things .
capital , chemistry and machines are at o@@ be@@ ying and it never made something really good for food .
in my shoul@@ der , i dro@@ ve an hour to school every day .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundar@@ ies of possible .
when i was watching a job as adult , it was the film@@ sho@@ ot .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s not going to be involved in the movie art . &quot;
because he led them to a pe@@ t@@ ched , he didn &apos;t hang himself on themselves .
we took little robots that we had built , which took a fi@@ ber op@@ d wire .
you invited them to eat it , not to eat nutri@@ tional the@@ ft .
now for me , for me , for the com@@ pos@@ ites , and what you now could do now for him today .
but su@@ c@@ c@@ essi@@ ve , the scri@@ pt as a primary medium , gave birth .
a second circle already begins to cor@@ rel@@ ate , or associ@@ ation .
that means that the first impres@@ sion happens in a ra@@ pid rate as we percei@@ ve things .
and this is something for us to be a little bit more intui@@ tive if i don &apos;t need to think about it .
that means that we &apos;re losing five times more than new .
there &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about a lot of time .
at such a lie , you see the li@@ ars don &apos;t believe what he says .
so , for example , there &apos;s going to be done to be done by the outside with music .
the question i can &apos;t sing , a , because they think they can &apos;t sing me ?
but what i would say already , because music is a beautiful , communication thing .
you know , bee@@ tho@@ ven knows that he listen@@ ed to more than he had been dea@@ f .
so the com@@ pos@@ ites of us interpre@@ ted to re@@ rein@@ vent the pieces that re@@ rein@@ vent the pieces again .
so we met in dec@@ ember the room in dec@@ ember of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
and he knew them , he would have been able to attra@@ ct the information to their contribu@@ tions .
the un@@ healthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one in the inner@@ ly sick .
and because of this , there &apos;s a fundamental human dig@@ ni@@ ty that needs to be respe@@ cted the law .
that as humans , as humans , they &apos;re not completely evol@@ vable , because we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic value .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our ri@@ ght-@@ direc@@ tional tra@@ its .
and the old ada@@ ge &quot; if it &apos;s flo@@ ating , demand is very true .
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we &apos;re living at a very pe@@ ful time of human history .
how many of you have the vic@@ tim super@@ computers of the risk of ib@@ ms from the risk of ib@@ ms .
so k@@ na@@ p is cont@@ amin@@ ated , and technology is a resource of freedom .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ i@@ . in the mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ th century .
a fear of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave you the finished .
she was born in 18@@ 8@@ 0s , and the experience of sla@@ very made their world &apos;s way strong .
he got in@@ tra@@ conven@@ ous anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and covered a few days later .
when did you hear the last time you &apos;ve heard of mis@@ er@@ ror mis@@ er@@ n@@ ess@@ ing mis@@ er@@ n@@ esses ?
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i was in 197@@ 1 , a la@@ g@@ on in western africa .
and i got a terrible sun@@ fire and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , rather than the 6@@ 0s -- pro@@ mot@@ ing europe , a lot of develop@@ mental projects .
we ada@@ pt to the new level of the new level and we don &apos;t care about what was there .
over time , it changes because it changes because for humans their employees are naturally natural .
that &apos;s mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , and so forth and so forth .
we don &apos;t want to provide life@@ -@@ to-@@ day pri@@ ces for kids .
so what is it for an idea to think about hon@@ dur@@ as &apos;s a whole new city ?
there are common@@ ly coming out of it when you put in your city 3@@ 11 ru@@ f@@ ts .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
this graph shows how it looked , as the video last summer came out for the first time .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single one-@@ day .
it &apos;s important to be the creativity that &apos;s in the internet culture of tech@@ ms and ge@@ e@@ ks .
two str@@ ings for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
so to do a reali@@ stic result , it &apos;s from me looking forward at planning .
and if you make good images , the result is quite beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve made , i want to share with you through a quick video .
and they &apos;ve been starting to realize that a average ce@@ o is doing 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in the week with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and cell@@ -@@ ta@@ p , called &quot; &quot; cont@@ amin@@ ated . &quot;
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver bag@@ s .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
now , why do we draw graph@@ s on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic kur@@ s ?
because the transition is very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle of the room .
i think the reason is that there &apos;s anything in the gan@@ ges .
i think the whole picture makes sense if you divi@@ ded it into a few billi@@ on-@@ year steps .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , brain cells , and so forth .
i have a very complicated , un@@ thin@@ ded and conf@@ used idea in my head .
i think it &apos;s very ti@@ red of us to say that we &apos;re the end up of evolution .
cer@@ ti@@ tious auth@@ ority ha@@ cking , and spu@@ t@@ ated cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in a different life , until you get your first million .
for us , and it &apos;s fundament@@ ally essential to the amount of relationships and the care of the toler@@ ance .
but at the time , as several thousand organisms , things were starting to change things .
and the argument here would be slowly ma@@ pping out of the evolution of evolution , but they &apos;re un@@ necessary .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose to decide .
so we thought that we could start writing a whole new chap@@ ter in the field of mo@@ bility .
i was the second volunte@@ er in the cam@@ ps , so i had a good chance to get there .
they help in the re@@ je@@ ction of food nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
he had understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and as someone surro@@ unded it , two different things .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people are equ@@ ally equal to their lives and cla@@ ws alone .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have social beings , the social nor@@ ms , the social nor@@ ms in question .
and the side kid@@ ne@@ ys , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
now you would think that the whole thing about categ@@ ories like me really would be happy .
and as part of that gave us a concept of an@@ atom@@ ical sam@@ ples .
or are we made something else -- something that might even be even better at the environment ?
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ ing in everything .
and in reality , if we put fail@@ ures , we often feel differently .
they have a sense of &quot; level 1 &quot; and &quot; + one star@@ ter &quot; or &quot; + 1 . &quot;
i have learned from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic to the 197@@ 0s .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate ag@@ ent effect , you have to reach the need@@ le .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not ste@@ am in the special way of producing meat .
is this something you can do because now you have a few minutes left ?
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades , of the national stati@@ stic .
our cities , in the last few years , are sc@@ or@@ ing with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough , how critical of this factor is for the quality of people &apos;s life .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players . 500 million people , the extraordinary good in &quot; something . &quot;
so i started to think about what it is in which these games are going to be able to fix us .
players love to be part of a@@ er@@ ial regi@@ ons of the mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary ma@@ mm@@ als .
i really hope that we play together more important games to survive on this planet than another century .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this ro@@ tten stuff like mani@@ ok .
you hear a lot about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says everything is related to everything connected .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s so much more valuable than it costs to build them .
man 2 : the brand , which i am , is , i would say , ne@@ g flying .
it &apos;s a up@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ tri@@ le ? are you something that comes blood in wh@@ ales ?
just to give you the over@@ all , i zo@@ om out , so you see what you get .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as you have no partic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ sts .
this is the first object you can see in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
how can we eat them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh , three times fresh .
either &quot; fl@@ ame fusion , &quot; or &quot; per@@ si@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; they have choices .
this sounds now ab@@ sur@@ dly , for you , as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ u@@ ency , it has to be appro@@ ved twice through con@@ gress .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than that , that less anymore .
on the one on the left , ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
when dan is a brand , he would probably be a classi@@ c pat@@ ch of the cab@@ rio of rio .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as though he is not .
so , i &apos;m reading for children , and i &apos;m probably probably most of america &apos;s life accoun@@ tors .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often described here .
if these spo@@ ts fall down , they can write the patterns , images , text artic@@ les .
no , they didn &apos;t have the building cont@@ amin@@ ated , it &apos;s just so that architecture is almost disappe@@ ars .
imagine if you could think of yourself in different forms or si@@ zes , in different ways , in different ways .
if you turn down the lights , it looks like this , so the same as we saw it before .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
now you look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
i thought , &quot; do you think the camera would mean &quot; dig@@ ni@@ ty that we wanted to lead a back@@ back conversation .
and after that , i decided to de@@ fy negative energy from my life .
while we cut down , i had this feeling , man &apos;s dying of dying , not terri@@ fying .
what would you do because you think they would be there forever ?
so for instance , the number 16@@ 4 looks very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t over@@ come it .
we need to go digital security systems where a human service service can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , in order to understand each other , i want to introdu@@ ce you to a fundamental , very simple kind of ni@@ c .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the lim@@ b , the rhyth@@ m of dan@@ cing in every culture .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and sou@@ x-@@ day self to us , who can afford to afford .
you will never forget , because i show you where d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog is .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is given in the pi@@ g to ex@@ ec@@ ute the soli@@ d parts .
by putting the foun@@ da@@ tions , he can actually interact the characters -- the characters pass them together .
to those arch@@ a@@ ic models , that we have a virtu@@ ally natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
how is this happening now with the virtu@@ ality of virtu@@ ality that &apos;s actually the most natural thing of the world .
virtu@@ ality has become completely alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
that sounds very no@@ is@@ y , and listening to sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction , i know .
but now there &apos;s a b@@ old , new solution to free us from this mis@@ er@@ able way .
and one reason is , this enormous heat war@@ mer he@@ els out of the north .
in china , a re@@ co@@ very is a re@@ co@@ very , so , yes , yes ?
and they &apos;re so designed using the design , which is simply impro@@ ving them .
you know , there are two countries who are starting to see a hundred percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us in the world in the world .
so , it &apos;s about making a large foot@@ print , which is a we@@ t@@ n@@ ine of a we@@ t@@ lands .
a television , or a was@@ hing machine that uses them , they don &apos;t care about them , they don &apos;t care about them .
if you &apos;re going to be surro@@ unded by yourself and you can get something nervous .
and the child is playing after a memor@@ ial , instead of having a red flo@@ wer , instead of having a blue flo@@ wer .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who don &apos;t care about new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the fish , the fish .
but what do vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
if he &apos;s a commit@@ ted place or a bag , is ir@@ relevant .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t seen it at the bottom level .
so , something profound like our identity is a question of choice , which is to show you a question of choice .
i teach an amazing amount of intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to be .
they need that gap to get a li@@ fel@@ ong to susta@@ in a self-@@ de@@ ception .
already today in a couple of flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e of yourself from the water .
it took some years to start with a bio@@ eth@@ ical view before we did the first experiments .
that was the first attemp@@ t to start with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
and i want to give you the proto@@ co@@ l that i &apos;ve been here for my part of my part of the day : thank you .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ ability of global climate climate system is the ni@@ ghts of the global climate system .
an example of a very different region of mon@@ et has pain@@ ted the se@@ ero@@ ero@@ x x-@@ time .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , just with hope .
you &apos;re going to have an ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ti@@ an admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , you &apos;re going to be signific@@ antly better .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low does is it actually helps to identify assu@@ mp@@ tions .
but at the end of this , i was going to realize that i was going to go to the deep sea with us in the deep sea .
so three very difficult problems that might be li@@ f@@ table , and you should be working on it .
one is the energy di@@ edi@@ ted that these technologies produce dra@@ matically as the power of plants .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other things called es@@ ol@@ ar that has the great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , french people and japanese have something in the direction .
and the prepar@@ ation to be enormous . we had to make c@@ ameras and light light and all kinds of things .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural species model for future .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually a commit@@ ted sport is a commit@@ ted sport .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re kind of thinking of no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to publi@@ sh the world green .
but these artic@@ les made me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and eventually i found out why , and eventually i found it .
we &apos;re at one point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress like that .
and here you can see the animals that are directly from a 500 degrees centi@@ grade that they can survive there .
if paul is speaking in a public re@@ view , he can &apos;t say &apos;t ar@@ med either .
so , maybe or stupid , it &apos;s a lot of our future to be a part of our future .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are requi@@ red to get a po@@ stage tun@@ a tun@@ a .
and what we can see now in a day in the day of day , you can find yourself in this third sentence .
so , in the way that we see the shift of the re@@ view of the evidence , the great common@@ ness of lying .
but not , we have seven percent , and the net is physi@@ cally seen by the european , the european .
we wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , ancient electrical battery battery battery .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the oceans as we &apos;ve be@@ aten the fore@@ sts .
but we know that if we &apos;re going to speak that , the social relationship is very sensitive .
or , you know , how can we create conditions that are capable of becoming able to feed yourself ?
on the day before , i called the ce@@ o of public work for the company .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t care about fish on fish ? &quot;
instead of moving the water , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to re@@ gress the water back .
they do it because they can follow the white line of the country a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no , because we &apos;re producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding the world .
categ@@ ories need to say something , not the one who provi@@ des the choice of choice .
in the recent day , she was going to go -- woman prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother , a mother and grandmother .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no ger@@ man in their treatment .
and sometimes , if something happens about ted , it gets a sense and strength that otherwise would not have .
we want to introdu@@ ce bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in pun@@ ish@@ ment system .
during the last three decades , the crimin@@ al rate of america is im@@ men@@ se .
and i think that we can &apos;t help anyone who can &apos;t help anyone .
: mal@@ ig@@ nant kar@@ tel@@ le -- dangerous cros@@ ses of cros@@ sing ves@@ sel@@ s .
and in spi@@ der , despite their log@@ o , she &apos;s going up@@ wards .
three billion new heads , which we never heard before , will be communic@@ ating global communication .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
you have to do the sound of the wind , throw it up and read the rest of the book .
as a child , i had colle@@ c@@ tors of mo@@ ck@@ ers , st@@ ene , ki@@ ck@@ les and mu@@ sh@@ ing .
both of these are strong under@@ ground because we don &apos;t care about the problem as we should think about it .
within a year you &apos;re going to go through a de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing , and you start with the be@@ en-@@ like fishing line .
we want to get things that are disappe@@ ared or things that don &apos;t care about anymore , as they were .
because obviously , the animal that gave it a lot of times , except before it dies .
here i think the art and the movie may be able to fill in the gap as well as simu@@ lations .
and the f@@ at@@ ti@@ ms may remember , &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
and this was an example , which is the way that our own governments use the technology against us , the citizens .
the second largest group that we can see now is not motiv@@ ated by money .
i spend most of my time with people in exam@@ in@@ ary prison , pris@@ ons or death cells .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order in which this information is pres@@ ented .
this creates a sort of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that actually made it .
it was about a way that the parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
this is because the government as a continu@@ ing ocean is , and politics is the su@@ pre@@ me 15@@ c@@ ame .
the next piece of puzz@@ le shows how a boat in the early ar@@ gen@@ d@@ al red l@@ ings is on the ocean .
for you , life had a task : the flight of your family and a new life in australia .
and the next piece of puzz@@ le is four women in three generations , which put together a new life together .
at the end of each day i &apos;m eating a huge po@@ et sou@@ p , which we shared .
you may think that this is just a landscape of a landscape , and the lower section was mani@@ pul@@ ated .
it &apos;s going to give this little blood prin@@ ting meas@@ ures , which is an iphone or so on .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21@@ st ap@@ p that &apos;s been recor@@ ded in the last year .
if you know something about government technology , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually work that way .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from the myster@@ y science theater was a first one who was in twitter with a jo@@ ke .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
they don &apos;t fight the struggle we &apos;re fighting , which is , who allowed to speak , they all talk to them ; they all talk to them .
well , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think this is something that &apos;s going to happen in the way here .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t make anything else , as information within the organis@@ m .
so for example , the re@@ gar@@ g@@ in@@ est of the study of communication is human language of communication is human language .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve started to abstra@@ ct humanity , we started abstra@@ ct .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ de cur@@ ve .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity as the normal metho@@ ds would allow us to produce .
it happened to me when we got to dre@@ am@@ t and c@@ ameras about it .
add the bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a noise machine .
this is also the clo@@ s@@ est of the talk , so i hope you &apos;ve enjo@@ yed you .
now , when i was a ne@@ ul@@ ing on the college , i had my first bi@@ ologi@@ sh cour@@ ses .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure , you &apos;re like , &quot; we &apos;re going to go from oil . &quot;
i found time that i &apos;ve spent in this hospital , just wonderful -- except my physi@@ ological therapy .
and perhaps we know what wood we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re really test .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; apo@@ logi@@ es , sir , know us ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
the human part of this bay , at the end , is , of course , what interests us most of us .
we know that as human beings work , we have a lot of important work doing important work .
because if we could find that , we had never been able to be there before .
evolution is all about the pas@@ sing of the genome , adap@@ ting and survival generation after generation , adap@@ ting and survival generation .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your neighb@@ or ?
why not have the fast mus@@ cles that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
using a society to form a society that is better , which is more successful , the friend@@ ly ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and pick up my strength and susta@@ in it .
they were playing a box , and the l@@ ens were on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
that means that we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or an evolutionary grandmother , which lived in front of six million years ago .
nothing goes into my sle@@ e@@ ve or comes out , not tri@@ ck@@ y , and you can study everything .
we know from those study that you need to reach at the need@@ le when it &apos;s supposed to go to the need@@ le .
unfortunately , the whole good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been often told .
people don &apos;t care in their faith , so close to that you can &apos;t de@@ fy it .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics who were mad at no threat at all .
but now , if you need to get the evidence , you have to take the evidence , and it &apos;s not good for us .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just going to tell you about a few nuclear sti@@ cky differences ?
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you rever@@ se it , and there &apos;s always something to do . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and what we tell us is tell stories that can keep us from our experience is to tell a story .
so we have remin@@ der ourselves , and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
now , if i had ever put up the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures of the age i &apos;ve spent another hour .
so , if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the self , you will end up doing very different things at the end of the self .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is the ex@@ act opposite to the future .
and so , by the way , it has since years since , i have to say , very successful introdu@@ ction .
in the rich world there are diseases that are only thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by one generation , bar@@ ely even a generation of one generation , har@@ dly even .
they sho@@ ot the decision -- push them up , even if it &apos;s interested in their own most good interest .
it could kind of have time to find english and it@@ -@@ quali@@ fied fun@@ ctions .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of the transpar@@ ency : what &apos;s changed now with the $ 7@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ th ?
i &apos;m going to talk to the demon@@ stration , and give you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings of pie@@ ter bre@@ ach@@ ers in the brea@@ thing .
so we could make the world a very simple way , maybe even hundreds of new cities out of new cities .
in the end , a study of ce@@ o did , where she was watching ce@@ o for a week for the ce@@ o .
so , to do things like -- you know , people re@@ minds people of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we care about invest@@ ing .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m sc@@ ared of privi@@ lege of privi@@ lege , because of the e@@ ase of privi@@ lege .
so for me it seemed to be the photograph@@ y , to be the right place to be at the right place .
so we &apos;re looking at our brains , because our brain isn &apos;t really conscious that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so there are all kinds of tools , and the only thing that over@@ ites us is our imagination .
and i think the most important point is that we have stopped talking with our patients .
if somebody would ask you to describe their mar@@ ken@@ or , your brand character , how would you ?
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it in a design work@@ shop .
so this is , when you look something , that &apos;s impossible , then it &apos;s impossible to do it .
and this sa@@ dness was really in a sense that i only had one of the wi@@ sh@@ es .
well , just to finish , i want to tell you that i talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ological impossible to be bad enough , if you put red red pants on .
if you pass to the right people , not only do you understand , you will value it .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to do this week is that it &apos;s okay , let &apos;s go out there .
my heart , i was s@@ mil@@ ky , as i was trying to do , what i was trying to do .
the green fa@@ thers were from my view of the original an@@ atom@@ ical activ@@ ist , and that &apos;s why .
who knows , if the film comes out , we might see a hor@@ o@@ di@@ ot of a ti@@ li@@ le .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
this gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ ing is not working with windows , they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- got me out of so@@ cket &apos;s so@@ cket .
the idea of this is obviously not only to say the machine services in the control room .
so we might sell a sho@@ e , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest sho@@ e that you &apos;ve ever made ...
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that &apos;s success@@ fully possible .
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ a , trial and er@@ ror , which is as meaning@@ less .
as peter told us peter , they don &apos;t only use the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
this question was so much that we developed to explore the research of the answer and pe@@ a@@ den@@ r@@ ene .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mix@@ ture sc@@ or@@ ky and bo@@ g@@ gle .
this is great . the ro@@ cket didn &apos;t really care that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
perhaps an old understanding of the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the creative insi@@ ghts .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no sti@@ cks , he didn &apos;t have any ta@@ pe recor@@ ds .
but once again , something special happened , and one of the carto@@ ons actually were tran@@ scen@@ dent .
40 percent of the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from this mel@@ ting water of this mel@@ ting water .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how they attemp@@ ted to the next century .
if we think about biological processes or any processes to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
i can acceler@@ ate all the whole sequence by turning the p@@ ace into one or another direction .
and so from interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going to go further on this technology .
this will not be ans@@ wer@@ ed to you , but it &apos;s going to happen , and this is happening right now .
i &apos;ve brought you with an example of the north american forest of no@@ ot@@ ca@@ -@@ indi@@ ans .
all this requires to accept our basic capacity to accept virtu@@ ality as a real life@@ -@@ living space .
the gre@@ e@@ ks origin@@ ated these go@@ di@@ c di@@ ets of creativity of creativity in mon@@ s .
because often people get people , they can &apos;t use it un@@ friend@@ ly , so that they allow us to deal with it .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , &quot; we could make a go , or we could make b .
there &apos;s actually a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , which is the wir@@ ing sche@@ me .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species actually exi@@ sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the grand@@ father of man didn &apos;t care about the arc@@ tic night or the we@@ ak@@ ing stor@@ m .
and this is really , really , really these ideas , the limit@@ s to the screen on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop pu@@ p and other non@@ sense of non@@ sense -- that should not be necessary .
we now have an infin@@ ite choice of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this is something called the pe@@ an@@ e@@ ful or just kind of psychology that actually influ@@ ences us in per@@ cep@@ tions .
the vi@@ ral particles were rele@@ ased by the cells , and they came back and killed . co@@ ke co@@ ke .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed this point for a lot of the time in the sele@@ ction .
if you break the gold glass glass so that everything is possible , you get the satis@@ fac@@ tion of happiness .
this is very much at full of security -- perhaps for fish , definitely for us .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred or something like this , or so those are here .
so we had to create a new way that we put these little pieces together and fix the mistake .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re looking at bes@@ i@@ de yourself from the ow@@ ner of the ow@@ ner .
his mother was im@@ pris@@ oned , as pun@@ ish@@ ment -- for cri@@ mes of well-@@ being .
you &apos;ve made sure that you didn &apos;t bi@@ ke . you won &apos;t leave the glass .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some se@@ ctions .
so , for example , there &apos;s a lot of people and looking at this , because you can see what the problems you get .
certainly i would never do an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p ship , which seemed pretty un@@ likely to me .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i got only two years on her face , when we moved to california .
here we can see a very fundamental service , at home , to get home to your home@@ work ?
i remember last year when i got mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to and kind of liked people who were doing it and kind of liked people .
immediately , you will get one of them , for gran@@ ted , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove it .
a third sentence that comes up to people who feel a strong sense of sou@@ l .
you see that there is a kind of p@@ ill@@ ar , often known as &quot; travel@@ ing wave re@@ actor re@@ actor . &quot;
this is basically the de@@ ad@@ line , which has demon@@ strated us the environmental models that we need to talk about .
that would have been , without the environmental requi@@ re@@ ment , but the power is so much more important .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor that seems a little bit hard , but maybe you say that about us .
say that there are nega@@ tional im@@ pac@@ ts that are shif@@ ting to the clou@@ ds that shif@@ ts things ?
here we can see again again , again , the same , single single ag@@ gre@@ gate gate .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our power on our own energy than it &apos;s going to change its lifest@@ ash .
for example , we have developed a scre@@ ak@@ y pac@@ ka@@ ged , which is liquid temperature .
and this is half the ab@@ und@@ ant problems in the world that are caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
it sounds so inten@@ se , but if you engage in that , it &apos;s very exciting when you engage in that .
that i &apos;m only doing this in a different way , and ni@@ tter@@ y , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a better hab@@ it .
over now , i &apos;m sort of acting with the object , and i can zo@@ om out again .
for example , at the end of the tr@@ ash , tw@@ ent@@ y of the fill in the tr@@ ash of wind .
but unfortunately , you can &apos;t do it in open , but maybe you can help the fr@@ a@@ gers even a little help .
it &apos;s important for the form that we &apos;ve made most of the first se@@ me@@ ster mon@@ keys , the great mar@@ g@@ ins .
we need to prevent the people who suff@@ er from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , for example , you need to have the learning process of music at least as long as the spo@@ ken language of music .
well , you can see , at all , nobody has no one of a smar@@ ter can@@ di@@ date .
i want to talk to you about this mechan@@ ism today , or something about what you &apos;re probably familiar with .
here it needs to understand what we understand under the co@@ il of cor@@ ri@@ t@@ ness , again .
she listen@@ ed to this book of charles darwin , the emergen@@ ce of the species and the tr@@ ash of human beings .
make it easy to use , and start to embra@@ ce them with this , patients in the team .
and to win , it has to be a better diagno@@ sis than a team of paper physi@@ cians .
i &apos;m going to take you into a stati@@ stic of that i &apos;m hop@@ ing that most of you already have before .
fam@@ ine in som@@ alia , speak@@ ers : p@@ pu@@ ff@@ y spra@@ y of police .
so if we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to be negative news .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century , so that we can see the development .
this s@@ ession is going to pro@@ position the money in more security be@@ ds and safety to invest in more security .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and determin@@ ed a de@@ fau@@ lt state and off@@ ic@@ er and off@@ -@@ off@@ ic@@ er .
in the high school , a scho@@ ol@@ teacher was told that brian gold@@ man would learn a flo@@ wer test for a pi@@ g .
if i put in a room -- like now , i have no idea what to think about me .
when i re@@ turned the 27 years later , the fish was s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by half of his hei@@ ght .
most of the mass mass in this country found not really in the class of violent violence in this country .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality to find these e@@ ds .
now , all the rema@@ ining resi@@ dents that were most accu@@ ra@@ cy at the best .
in fact , these programs are so much efficient than any program i could have typ@@ ed by hand .
so in other words , the future has been re@@ moved every year for a year since i &apos;m in the world .
we &apos;re starting an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the mi@@ d-@@ second area .
we say , &quot; computers , gener@@ ic please have taken a hundred million in@@ struc@@ tions of in@@ struc@@ tions .
and how many people , i thought , most of the time , is that it &apos;s really about raising people to vote in a t .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go into the court and put this crazy case .
i ad@@ ore my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , om@@ a , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
in this country , for example , there &apos;s a life@@ -@@ to-@@ ha@@ un@@ t@@ ary pri@@ ority of people with no enti@@ ties .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us out .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion st@@ ones have been produced -- or 75 st@@ rooms for each person on this planet .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; near &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
we have the social impact in a socie@@ tal change that has caused in lots of cases through a technologi@@ cal change .
and also , there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story , why we &apos;re there , and what we have to do .
his work is geni@@ us . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
so he says , in fact , there &apos;s actually sense , because players can reach in online worl@@ ds more than real life .
we have this fi@@ ber in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it looks like we should understand the future .
and the last game is going to go on the third . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
but dan@@ ny , in the entire american survey is about living , freedom , the as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions of happiness .
wi@@ dri@@ tion@@ ists aren &apos;t ob@@ stac@@ les that we need to have to deal with for our lives better .
and we don &apos;t care about the children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt to them .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of wi@@ dri@@ tion@@ ality , a sense of the i@@ .@@ d. , a sense of our own power .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ l@@ ace . &quot;
if a mind has a mind about these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new version of new forms .
but not just any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
but it &apos;s not just that -- that &apos;s how we mel@@ te and connect them with the universe and other device out there .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ cy , which helps you to go to the h@@ ills .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment -- 70 percent .
if anyone had built a tent@@ h of in@@ struc@@ tional design , he would have taken the price home .
and the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , the right system , the right system .
and you can go into the past , you can &apos;t go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
they &apos;ve made the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of the earth in a way that no war has done .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article on vac@@ cin@@ ation for &quot; the new yor@@ kers &quot; a little article .
at home in new york , i &apos;m che@@ f of the developing di@@ vision of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ am lau@@ gh .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they &apos;re not going to get the cor@@ rect answer .
we can move them where we &apos;re going to move it , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned about is something that the world needs now .
it &apos;s actually so true to its place that i can sha@@ ke it , without turning the kni@@ fe down .
it &apos;s about how satis@@ fied or deli@@ gh@@ ted that person is when this person is thinking about her life .
and the primary lesson that i believe is that they &apos;re really different , that they &apos;re really different .
and you &apos;re all going to share all the nutri@@ ents that you could only care about without eff@@ ra@@ zine on the table .
so , the performance of working with prototyp@@ es , etc , -- but look at how different teams are doing .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve obser@@ ved with the so-@@ called gre@@ g@@ g@@ ap@@ x@@ el@@ -@@ engineering technology .
i &apos;m going to go into one of my favorite part of this picture , until i &apos;m really at risk .
but look at the problem that my idea was a f@@ at@@ al mistake , and that was following .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
i have to talk to the man who are like me , ot@@ ot@@ ing , the normal consumer users .
well , because the film of s@@ und@@ ance has film festi@@ val , could we look at this .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this way away .
some of you may have heard about this a few weeks ago at e@@ bay .
so , in the large and large , we &apos;re very hop@@ e@@ ful that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is .
each of you , everybody -- whether rich or poor or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t make any role .
you can go and create online your own museum -- all of these pictures you can put your own colle@@ ction .
and so they wrote all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , imagine they were at the same time in several places , how would it feel ?
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o was the link to the ted@@ talk .
it turns out that it really meant that it really meant to do with her film . &quot;
and , although it seems really , it &apos;s really hard to do because it ten@@ ds to work very quickly .
ice ber@@ ks is born as a sp@@ in of a gl@@ aci@@ er or by pol@@ asing pol@@ ase .
then , one day he came back from running , and said , &quot; dad , my legs , cr@@ b@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
i have a lot of time on my life attemp@@ ting to be myself , and at the same time .
the next day , everybody went to go to the center and meet the prime minister at the same time .
so we actually designed some small mar@@ ker in this project to gui@@ de the tr@@ ash while through the system .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them , colle@@ c@@ tively , colle@@ c@@ tively .
through my work , i attemp@@ ted to say that people don &apos;t separate from nature , and that everything is connected .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep it , and believe it feeling meaning@@ ful .
the ro@@ tor is this moving piece within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , these black regi@@ ons that you see .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who contribu@@ tes all of this , it can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
well , an epi@@ ph@@ any is something that you can find because you drop somewhere down there .
i don &apos;t want this thing to be frag@@ mented in 20 parts , how you know it from docum@@ ent@@ ations .
and it seemed to have something to do with this gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ ing , that real ice system systems .
so , it was us to get the little digital explo@@ ch with the ro@@ tor@@ ian contro@@ ls .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have the stable structures .
now it &apos;s a language not only the sum of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ matic sym@@ ne@@ ys .
they lie , they s@@ hr@@ ink , they &apos;re conf@@ used , they &apos;re being conf@@ used and they &apos;re really mad .
and it &apos;s about having a play@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
so , as citizens are able to be able to be able to engage with these kinds of acade@@ mic technologies .
the next slide that i show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se thing in the last 25 years .
if you want to know how the marine level of the ocean mel@@ ts through the ocean mel@@ ting into the ocean .
there &apos;s a old african ada@@ ge : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ acc@@ acc@@ i series that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
there &apos;s such a ti@@ tle thing like this all these genetic forms of techniques on the squ@@ at@@ ers .
and the result is , no matter where i come from , be treated as if the under@@ gradu@@ ation is .
he lives in the deep sea , about a one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half miles down , in virtu@@ ing water temperature .
and therefore , it &apos;s so powerful in us that we can be so sc@@ u@@ m@@ ht@@ forward to the virtu@@ ality of virtu@@ ality .
what happened is the age age and happened is the book , and what happened is that the book is called a me@@ tab@@ oli@@ graph .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , which bring us back to re@@ discover the possibility of our skills again .
maybe you just stand up for your short time , so you can get yourself at rec@@ ess with the two on the project .
well , what you can see here , sorry , is another explan@@ ation of what you &apos;re seeing right now .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to pop up your fra@@ ctions and put your percentage of the paper .
back to my top@@ ic theme , and the subject of what , of course , is the end of the world , etc . , etc . , etc .
we made small pieces , made a mistake , and had a dna molecule about 5,000 letters .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they kind of rec@@ ru@@ ited this model .
you can only be taken into connection with some other chemicals that the ma@@ o den@@ u@@ late .
well , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph@@ .@@ d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than you have a stem on@@ tr@@ ine .
his un@@ cle fle@@ w with her sa@@ in@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , which brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
and it doesn &apos;t care how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big that colle@@ c@@ tors are , or how big the images are .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribu@@ te to this area .
that , at once , this looks always infin@@ ite to success , just the us@@ ence , a app@@ lic@@ ation will be a ap@@ p .
and we think that we will be the first with the fu@@ els of the fourth generation , and this is about 18 months .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life lies in space and move , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
it &apos;s clearly that it &apos;s very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward with a virus , and it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria to deal with bacteria .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of biology , a lot of biology .
the electr@@ on@@ ics had a do@@ zen compon@@ ent , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it looks . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look like their genetic code .
when profess@@ ors get more curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the &apos; n &#93; research .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you will be taken by the spirit . how can you be feeling damage ?
if we can do that , this is the bi@@ dest data tra@@ p , maybe a new source of information , perhaps a new source of information .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
&quot; i know boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the top lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable .
at the moment , when there was a film director , there would have been a view of a view of a stage change .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because , you know , the lo@@ gic of our food system has over the last 50 years .
that was the lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion . it was the pre@@ fer@@ ences of the american agriculture .
this is really important because this is a reali@@ zation that &apos;s not in a single wi@@ di@@ di@@ ot .
and yes , the discussion is always about how far you can get there a piece of future .
you have to go to the battery , you also have to be able to communicate the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
and i noticed how much deep@@ -@@ sea counter@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ ol@@ ds were coming along with a space mission .
and then we started , we came up to the bis@@ bis@@ ck , and they explor@@ ed it with robo@@ tic wit@@ n@@ esses .
but energy and climate is extremely important to these people , actually even more important than anyone on the planet .
and there are definitely un@@ clear about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day long , it doesn &apos;t care about every day and also as well as the wind doesn &apos;t care about .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in wal@@ t dis@@ ney , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney in the wal@@ t .
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , that there is a chance in a million .
his cause to write the piece is more and more and more of my personal concern@@ s to play it .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a couple of f@@ at@@ er@@ al po@@ ts , but to get some more involved in this .
every year we &apos;re going to lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which actually has to go back in cir@@ cles .
in h@@ oll@@ and , you understand that because in h@@ oll@@ and , the land is built on flo@@ wers .
because the soil is going to die the mo@@ o@@ sis , and the water and the water and the water is pul@@ ling away the ground .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of sel@@ fish plants , so that you contribu@@ te through the ar@@ bio@@ diversity of bio@@ diversity .
there are extra contribu@@ tions to cra@@ d@@ le cra@@ d@@ le , where everyone can be partici@@ p@@ ated .
this is , as i would say , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h your child , it only takes three times less than five times .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the day over the da@@ y@@ time seas@@ ons .
and when i get to my little v , i &apos;m going to be able to get this feeling up there .
no , the lying that i &apos;m talking about , has to do with it that they fa@@ ke themselves .
but there &apos;s no one that we can look at where you &apos;re learning , where you &apos;re learning , how you &apos;re learning how to make fire .
so , you know , those words that we &apos;re starting to use in the political &apos;s language is constantly re@@ using .
the first example requires what many of you know about , and some of you esti@@ mate , very few of them don &apos;t care at all .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , as much valuable for them than they cost them .
so imagine that these artificial intelligence of a mobile mobile phones is available to be available .
so what can be three billion , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of the human community who taught us ?
if we wanted to travel in the back , we jum@@ ped into a car and s@@ hr@@ ink over the hea@@ v@@ ens .
it &apos;s important for me to do something that is indian , but it &apos;s also very ti@@ red .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no , do it . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot;
here , in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of male dea@@ ths were perman@@ ent in their vot@@ es .
after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there were these will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this country .
so the neurons are the information process@@ ing systems that have built these cell communities .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the ab@@ und@@ ance , as nobody could ever have predi@@ cted .
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , which is exactly the same code and the same not@@ ation .
and it turns out that today , the human pattern dete@@ ctions make better proteins as the best super@@ computers .
never make a mistake , nobody makes the details of how this should be done .
i re@@ gre@@ t it , but i &apos;m trying to learn how to do it for others to pass other people to others .
you see , the la@@ d@@ back of pal@@ men and a pair of man@@ gro@@ ves surro@@ und .
they found a paper with fal@@ se mus@@ cles , could they dete@@ ct the cre@@ ase of this thought .
for example , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ills in u@@ kra@@ ine .
one way of which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been doing recently is , is evolution itself .
from the people who are dying at the age of 24 , they just bought three percent of a glass stam@@ er .
we &apos;re so far that , only for pleasure , to be able to write anything in this code .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when the ex@@ clu@@ ders are pres@@ ented .
please help us , and try it , not only to improve the health , but to take it in your hand .
and the first thing i &apos;ve been asking is , &quot; tell me how ways to diff@@ er from each other .
now we want to talk about how videos will be vi@@ ral , and finally , so that &apos;s important .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my sen@@ ded the t@@ we@@ et , which made the video so popular .
and i was put in a piece of puzz@@ le for the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ tic , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t tie together .
but my interest in photograph@@ y , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
and if you take a picture with a camera , end of the process , if you put up on the board .
and the more you give up , the more we put her whole money on p@@ ure markets .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
so these counter@@ -@@ in@@ si@@ d@@ ited to survive longer , and they multi@@ pl@@ yed it in si@@ gh@@ ted rate .
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year , the code for america &apos;s code .
we had a team who worked on a project in boston last year in boston for three and a half and a half months .
we &apos;re here at this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i &apos;m also starting to ask myself a lot of myself , is like this new world being going to be ?
to do this , i &apos;m first going to talk about some other things , which is really nothing to do with technology or computers .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the people in the re@@ fin@@ ed chemicals spread into the same amo@@ unts of disease .
for this non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its had another material , electrical electr@@ on@@ ics , just another material .
so for example , i worked with people who are am@@ es@@ i@@ ved tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
it &apos;s important to understand that that person could actually consider them , but they don &apos;t really care .
they don &apos;t have these people as a ho@@ st and they use it , but they were treated as a special and valuable treatment .
his flexi@@ ble design allows you to get deep , to get a slow and get perfect mov@@ ements .
we &apos;re starting to imagine that with our industrial part@@ ners that this is a new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that year .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the gul@@ f ur@@ ds , and the obser@@ vation only has to be hard to acc@@ essi@@ ble .
i think , just as you &apos;re playing , sometimes , and we &apos;re l@@ ung@@ ing on our inner and outside of the rest of the world .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that can read , if they &apos;re goo@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; super@@ lo@@ wers &quot; goo@@ gl@@ y .
find out how they would survive . most of them have the sta@@ tic hab@@ it in the game .
the rul@@ er of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es out of the second hand , and in the t@@ d-@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ ed sh@@ ops .
and then we have the little chi@@ ps , the little mar@@ ks , and started to follow him .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but if you &apos;re approach@@ ing it , it will open and you put it in .
this is just an example of many , as adults in power posi@@ tions , the imagination of a child .
the first time i was in the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first pol@@ ase ber@@ ries .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it in the way that we can do it today .
he gets home , because the people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
let &apos;s take a look at the burning fossil fu@@ els , which is either coal of coal or natural gas .
al gore book book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys &quot; &quot; energy energy &quot; the hot air . &quot;
we need market ri@@ ce , co2 , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade , which creates a price signal .
and they &apos;re going to invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they sk@@ et@@ ch and put sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
and that &apos;s the team , which is regul@@ ated and on work , the performance of the team is tar@@ ge@@ ted .
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;m doing is very young -- some thousand years old .
we want to introdu@@ ce the best possible results , and then people em@@ power@@ ing the idea of the reality in reality .
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in terms of two types of self .
maybe something too much time when you think of how many problems we &apos;re doing in the real world .
and maybe some of you have the new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; read &quot; flying . &quot;
the second largest wi@@ ki of the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
and the only problem is they believe you can change the virtual world , but not the real .
it could have all individual points of an impul@@ se that comes from people , from the mo@@ des of people or the same .
the idea was really tan@@ gi@@ ble to you , you know that there is people who live with mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to .
and even though i had my gradu@@ ated , i realized that i could not find a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
most of our ideas were mad , but they were a bunch of brilliant things , and we made the break@@ through .
who could predict &quot; &quot; rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or &quot; re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; predi@@ ction ?
there was only my sister and i , and , you know , my grandmother and my grandmother .
they opened up a computer business , made a co@@ con@@ ti@@ le training and opened up a store .
in one was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , the un@@ in@@ ver@@ t@@ less requi@@ re@@ ment requi@@ re@@ ments of themselves .
she remin@@ ded me that i was as old as she was then , when we got the boat .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you vote in sele@@ ction .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man auto@@ maker who gave you the ability to do your car completely to con@@ figure your car .
a few days later , we went into a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ar@@ ray and sa@@ sat to her sar@@ g .
and she said , &quot; why are your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
but if we com@@ bine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because you just look at something wrong .
this program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace supply for the computer ge@@ e@@ ks .
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about them , they re@@ pair them .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my is asking new and interesting things , and show you a great audience .
it was a docum@@ ent@@ ary docum@@ ent@@ ary , but actually , in fact , the science of science , which is really , really scientific : space science .
but usually i have an es@@ say , as sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such stuff .
they have companies like ne@@ cks , fe@@ ats , hall@@ mark , hall@@ mark .
he needs the same -- he needs me , love and enjoy , and it &apos;s on us , these things .
while i later thought about it , i noticed a saying , which is : &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
about a month after this , i came to meet my daughter , and the gra@@ ders , not much of arti@@ stic talent ...
the most important post there is for development of nuclear weapons is the equivalent in@@ centi@@ ves in nat@@ ance .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , looking at the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing adverti@@ sing .
you can see here he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat moves up to the other side , the man stands up there .
they &apos;re deci@@ ding more to things that they care less about themselves , even if they make it obje@@ ctive .
they &apos;re establi@@ shed , tradition@@ ally , care , com@@ passionate , com@@ passionate to com@@ ra@@ h ?
in the entire city , there hasn &apos;t been no instru@@ mental n@@ ine , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to talk to this digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ an , we could read your brain .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city where they &apos;re willing to be the only city that they wel@@ come .
i decided that this was free of light to@@ m@@ bles my wish to the environment to the environment .
they don &apos;t even care about them ; that means , if nothing ever gets done , they &apos;re already dead .
these are very good things and ar@@ mu@@ ts@@ a redu@@ ction means to make these services almost available to each one on the planet .
it &apos;s an interesting kind of app@@ lic@@ ation in this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions .
i first have to catch out a little bit , and this is bio@@ ha@@ cking with the modern molecular biology .
i had work , or ideas that came out from a source through me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
if you really want to be , come to a che@@ aper moment , if i can take care of yourself .
because you see that i &apos;ve got everything i have , i don &apos;t have anymore than that .
but it doesn &apos;t happen to be very powerful enough to do the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it shows not the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
here are the ones who &apos;ve been che@@ cked in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives that were pres@@ ented .
it &apos;s the da@@ wn of the human human@@ ism and people starting to believe that creativity is entirely from their individual individual .
but in the old gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
and then there &apos;s a do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o &apos;s or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ bi@@ o .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors were going to go into the room , put this hel@@ met together .
and then you can get the particles strong enough , and then you go into the oni@@ ons in the oni@@ ons .
now we think , for example , the stories on the way that we eat as a child on the la@@ p of our parents .
you probably know that when you &apos;re interested in this , the austr@@ ali@@ an ur@@ ani@@ ans .
and it turns out , and distribu@@ tes entire e@@ go , and it creates all of those un@@ reach@@ ed expec@@ tations for success .
because she &apos;s pro@@ se@@ min@@ ing an assu@@ mption on the front that you see something that you see , which you see , un@@ clear circle .
and these other things like a lot of attra@@ ctive properties , and it &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do less attra@@ ctive .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they all came to -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
so , in@@ born is nei@@ ther of the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , you &apos;re going to be sel@@ ec@@ ted by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ y pictures , and all of you are in the way that you are in the relationship with each other .
and this is really exciting when you think about the pl@@ ou@@ si@@ tic information , which has many of these pictures .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll be going to be there soon .
i &apos;m going to give you another type of quick example of invest@@ ing in volun@@ t@@ ary ages .
if i &apos;ve seen this that there was a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog in it , you know this .
here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of at@@ las in the construction of the way that you see the greater propor@@ tions .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just that they don &apos;t help .
so we think that this is actually going to be able to do a situation in the software , in a biological system , in a biological system .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell has no one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded .
now i have argu@@ ments that this is not the gene -- that &apos;s based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
in a short time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
i &apos;ve been asking myself , if this s@@ ack is a s@@ ack , and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
and i don &apos;t like to say the vo@@ ot@@ o@@ can , &quot; you white go into church and talk about god .
you know , this is right , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s deli@@ cious .
it &apos;s because in the middle here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re at the most part over there .
and while i was playing , i was aware that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ an &apos;s eyes , there was a complete version of change going on .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ ans man@@ bi@@ ger turned into understanding , in understanding , in a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and an@@ x@@ iety .
even better , he was born in a@@ qu@@ ak@@ ul@@ ently after the sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly of the sustain@@ ability of sustain@@ ability .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three se@@ wers , and part of a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to the k@@ is@@ s .
and my head was we@@ ak over this co@@ ok piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had at the end of the day .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been seeing right now in the last two years , that scientists put on my page .
it &apos;s not , you know , touch , child exer@@ cis@@ fully , we &apos;ve calcul@@ ated everything , never math .
now , if i look at this , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this copy and the spor@@ ts form .
the phan@@ tom of imagination doesn &apos;t know bor@@ ders , contr@@ ary to our own , sound human imagination .
so far to day today , i find deep fear for what i see in my di@@ ve .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as though i was in a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction film .
and to look at it , and watching the inside of the ship , which never has been done before .
he talked about invisible speak@@ ers and r@@ ings and about how someone wanted to put him in the sleep .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally involved in the ship re@@ fu@@ ge of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means that the water sta@@ ys longer in the me@@ a@@ dow .
so no longer saving , avoid avoid avo@@ i@@ dance , don &apos;t reduce school admini@@ stration , but smart waste .
in the last 20 years , five thousand tons of copy@@ on in germany have been spread in germany .
so all western rich is always exp@@ and@@ ing until you didn &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then you &apos;re capable .
you could be so easily blo@@ wing a li@@ ter al@@ le@@ ly , and then it would be ru@@ ined over years .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined , you will be the first country in the world , which is phosp@@ hor@@ us re@@ w@@ inging .
that &apos;s not exactly why , because because we don &apos;t know how much run@@ away , it &apos;s going to be done .
can i use that directly , or i can use it , or i can finish it up to the school book .
that means that , at the moment , you need to care that the rene@@ w@@ able energy is kind of able to take the entire net .
you think that the compon@@ ent is all in the notes in the notes , everything he came up with .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he had emer@@ ged , when i finally started studying .
and the organis@@ m has invented a great techni@@ que to make such un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like spi@@ ders , just to disappe@@ ar .
that the person should come from the mon@@ keys , and , yes , it would be a common ance@@ st@@ or there among people and mon@@ keys .
you have to have another version of this , a perman@@ ent sti@@ cker from the philosoph@@ y of the philosoph@@ y , present .
and sure , if we could have this hy@@ dr@@ hy@@ hy@@ se all the time , and many people do this .
you &apos;ve seen this audience in this audience , and you &apos;ve heard to help you and to do something .
this spi@@ ritual action is the core of what i believe is also the ted community to engage on it .
so western governments provide al@@ al@@ re governments with resources to deliver their own citizens to their own citizens .
how does it compare to the arab spring and things that have happened in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
and because you can explain this idea in one minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about time to use time .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i paint . &quot;
although al@@ umin@@ um is at 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it &apos;s not as p@@ ure metal .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers got sil@@ verti@@ ber@@ e , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself got gol@@ d-@@ be@@ d re@@ ste@@ yer .
i &apos;ve done time , and after the best head@@ lines that i could find .
i think we need to do more to help people become vic@@ ti@@ ms of a offen@@ se , not less .
if i was in reality , i would have been writing it , and put it in the room .
let &apos;s say , well , i want to use nuclear re@@ ference , which is a simple example that i &apos;ve used already .
we would never fly anyone with an airplane if for nine air@@ planes , which stre@@ tch off a dis@@ k .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the three year-old children who are con@@ vi@@ cted to death in prison .
in so@@ cially and black parts of the population , we have des@@ pair , hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people to say things that they don &apos;t care about .
the poor sar@@ as were caught in in@@ dr@@ as cam@@ els for thousands of years in an old mu@@ ff@@ ous book .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can fit in a single mar@@ m .
well , the lunch before , and i &apos;m thinking , now , before i sel@@ ec@@ ted it , before i just sel@@ ec@@ ted .
now i say , &quot; computers , &quot; now , take those 10 percent of the sequences that have happened to me next .
in the mean@@ time , in the same year , the next revolution announ@@ ced the next revolution , the next building block .
and if you look at the indepen@@ dence of indepen@@ dence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
we find men in the mar@@ g@@ in ri@@ vels , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ u , a female female , and she plays peace with water .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born in a body , two people in a body .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re taking people living for living organs , and they want to grow other people .
reali@@ zing that these categ@@ ories really have a lot of in@@ sur@@ ance than we thought , &quot; make me wonder .
i know that they were ras@@ s@@ ms , i know that they were jud@@ gment , but they were great .
or will we sele@@ sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us and not for other people ?
i mean , think , if ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o was thinking of their own picture , think about bacteria ?
well , i want to re@@ gar@@ d@@ ently , i want to rei@@ ter@@ ate that , in fact , that there &apos;s an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds are right to get their insi@@ ghts to sex , or to get married .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical separ@@ ations that make sense to me , and that , i think , keep stopp@@ ing .
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states today .
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but it sometimes feels like the science is self-@@ interest .
not long after having a doctor in my room and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you can never walk again . &quot;
so , if we try to make people a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
6@@ 0,000 dollars in a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get increasingly happ@@ ier , the more rich you get .
d@@ k : you know , i think there &apos;s recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness in politics .
and the reason i artic@@ u@@ late my wr@@ ist is that the secret of the illusion is that it &apos;s the secret of the illusion .
the stories of the inte@@ st@@ ine were different , because a very critical part of the story is how they end up .
and this is true for the story that the memory and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we create .
now , because the post-@@ thinking is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to ch@@ ase what happens to people who are moved to california , to be happ@@ ier .
if you think you &apos;re inside and out a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so i looked at games like the world of war@@ craft , which is the ide@@ al environment for collabor@@ ative problems .
and where you go , hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to engage their epi@@ ky mission .
this was the first strategy in time of the world of war@@ cra@@ cy series 16 years ago . this was 16 years ago .
point is the calcu@@ lation of a super@@ computer that people only have 23 years on the planet .
sometimes i realize that he is very present , sometimes he &apos;s har@@ dly seeing , but he &apos;s always in me .
in the fe@@ min@@ ism , it &apos;s about taking attention to gender , so there &apos;s nothing to be fe@@ min@@ al about gender .
it wrote me a few weeks ago , and i told them a little bit of a sh@@ ri@@ mp .
there was a meeting meeting , and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
and because of this aid i was in my last year last of ju@@ assi@@ studying , as a young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that was in h@@ ill , rather than hundreds of kilometers away from the north .
and he showed up on the bus char@@ ges of tou@@ ri@@ sts , which came up everyday , and usually their c@@ ameras did .
it turns out that in fact , we can actually deal with more information than we think we &apos;ve got to simpli@@ fy them .
half the cli@@ ent is going to go from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 auto colors to the ger@@ ms of the time , four ge@@ ars .
my mother used to work on far@@ ms , and in a stre@@ tch in a car factory , six days , double la@@ yers .
this is the left half , which is the lo@@ gic side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive side .
i think , finally , to me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can identify with all of us in a three-@@ dimensional world .
it &apos;s really important that the tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ings work , but people ste@@ aling the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please ask you that you care about it because things are changing , because the things are changing .
so if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process which is very different from classi@@ cal engineering creatures .
that was the state of physics in a number of years ago ; it needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or twitter . &quot;
so i saw them at the same time , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve made a few birds . &quot;
it could say , for example , an american power plant , or a chemical plant in germany , or a chemical plant in germany .
another quick example of feeling : here &apos;s not the people , but to do things that we use and consu@@ me .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps , which is a ma@@ c computer , how you came together .
all the kids out of zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building because the way she was playing with the building was very different .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a smo@@ oth forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
while the ice mountain mel@@ ted , it &apos;s miner@@ ating miner@@ al drin@@ king water , which is a lot of life@@ -@@ changing ni@@ ghts .
and as a computer in the free , you start to respond to other kinds of ways , and you &apos;re actually being driven and driven .
nothing to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have any control , because they had no control , no control of the finished product .
it &apos;s starting to go out on the che@@ hin@@ check nuclear power and in@@ centi@@ ves in nat@@ ness .
the great digital explo@@ head -- we got insi@@ ght into that by looking at a very simple and data structure .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years trying to put me in situations , which usually nar@@ ro@@ ws , and also dangerous , kind of dangerous .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
and you can see here , no , wi@@ i , min@@ i co@@ op@@ er , and je@@ t@@ ney .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary dea@@ ths in a country , which is worse than any other of this disease .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what are the amazing species of being able to do .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did what i always did , i wrote a paper and dro@@ ve .
and what &apos;s the interesting thing about this is that the auth@@ ority and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of regi@@ ons of songs could be trained .
and this project , as example , is brought to me as an arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models add@@ ressed add@@ res@@ sing .
i want to start to think of them as much of your childhood , when they s@@ mile with building blocks .
then , after about 30 seconds , it turns out , and you have a new letter combin@@ ation and new opportunities to experiment .
and you eat it , just using a ton@@ gue car@@ r@@ able to a sequence of sequence .
and then the effects like p@@ ace and volu@@ me , which you use to the whole sequence .
and this is not stop at ho@@ b@@ by@@ feld , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that &apos;s also a lot of really cool .
he was ligh@@ t@@ led by the inside , and from the bottom lights , and all the lights were happy through a di@@ vin@@ al fire .
so i took my vision out of the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i talked about my com@@ ment in a blan@@ k corner of space .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , the data that we produce with the real world .
now i know this and now i &apos;m going to get to the front that i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog .
but i want to say that for us , it &apos;s a de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing produ@@ c@@ tivity , of course things too .
this is , it &apos;s not about saving , it &apos;s not about saving , to avoid disease .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ gical ru@@ ck@@ s@@ ack , actually , which is made in the cycle of the cycle .
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which emer@@ ged over a few under@@ water is@@ lands , is particularly powerful in mel@@ ting .
now , i &apos;m older as a little bit of the age of ch@@ op@@ in , as he wrote the piece .
now we &apos;re trying to wonder if we can re@@ generate life or whether or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to really be mis@@ er@@ able .
if we asked those un@@ coun@@ t@@ ings of global cultures after the meaning of humanity , answers with 10,000 different voices .

this is what i &apos;m calling . he &apos;s called at@@ las , 4@@ 4 feet in diam@@ e@@ ter , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
you can do it because if you cool them very far , they &apos;re called the super@@ conduc@@ tor .
when i listen@@ ed to that , i was sick -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process process is going on : thank you very much like my creative process .
it &apos;s also wonderful , if i stand with a du@@ o partner on the stage and we have the same wave wa@@ ils .
and as much as the bio@@ sphere has been car@@ ried in , it happened to no@@ no@@ sphere -- just greater speed .
at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i could have my pre@@ ference for the under@@ water world and the di@@ ving with the film .
from those two experiences , a whole new world came up with a whole new world of creativity .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new concept of agriculture , from one in which food actually ta@@ stes good ta@@ stes .
so you realize that this looks very much like this information and data in this way of swi@@ mming in a living informa@@ tional graph .
now what we have here is the ti@@ tle images of the individual spor@@ ts illu@@ strated , which had ever been prin@@ ted .
in math , i was always caught by the teacher , as i was , back@@ wards sch@@ ol@@ ar .
i made my di@@ ve in a pool of y@@ m@@ ca in the middle winter , new york .
it turns out that mi@@ da@@ el has spent the largest part of his career in mi@@ k@@ mi@@ i national park in africa .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of b@@ und@@ les that re@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an ra@@ pes .
i &apos;ve convinced you , by convin@@ cing , &quot; we di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we sho@@ ot the real re@@ ck@@ ard .
to me , young film@@ makers say , &quot; give me an ad@@ vice , as i can do something like this . &quot;

they bre@@ ed in a city 2@@ 40 miles away , where the soil lo@@ com@@ o@@ x nature is better for the nest building .
what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , you have no longer time , and what happens ?
i &apos;m always telling you the politicians , if you put it in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ jac@@ ent .
if we had a percent of them in europe , we have the same problems that people have on this island there .
because i don &apos;t think somebody , i don &apos;t know if it ta@@ stes it , because i can &apos;t co@@ il .

this el &apos;s going to be ba@@ king up and the wind , sun &apos;s bur@@ ying the bur@@ den , that they can create the wi@@ der percentage .
but if you want to get several of these things together , you want to build a net together , that &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
that means , if you &apos;re in seven percent rene@@ w@@ able , you can &apos;t do it without any memory .
because the music allows him to do his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with his imagination and creativity in a real re@@ stor@@ ation .
i was under the star@@ ving sky in the desert with su@@ ri@@ gen sing@@ ers , al@@ i .
look at what &apos;s actually going on in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks in categ@@ ories .
in@@ ot@@ ot@@ ot@@ ar is a full cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate of the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- -- was it that .
we &apos;ve heard a lot of times about the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
every generation is looking at the images that you spend at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and everything will be de@@ dic@@ ated .
what about the people who don &apos;t have it is because they have no access to -- people in the mid@@ west for example ?
in a hospital system in which the medical health system has dou@@ bled all the two to three years , we can &apos;t mi@@ mic .

my brother said , &quot; well , do it . we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re not doing anything that we &apos;re doing .

there &apos;s a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting mu@@ kes of nine countries .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this se@@ arch@@ ing -- art deli@@ ber@@ ate -- using technology with technology .
so we go out and play and look at how it respon@@ ds , and then we start to develop it in our intui@@ tions .
i was asked to come to te@@ hr@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary , a talk to speak .
you see , when you &apos;re transpar@@ ency at the google search , this is one of the first images , which seems out .
so if you asked me this one year ago , i would not have been able to tell you this , with wisdom .
today i want to talk about one of the largest decisi@@ on-@@ making problem of our modern era , making decisi@@ on-@@ making decisions .
there are more people in love when it were 24 , about 60 percent , when there were six , roughly 40 percent .
those who really want to make an ele@@ ction will be off@@ ered 20 fund , not 300 or more f@@ on@@ ds .
and the other half of the cli@@ ent is about the mo@@ od possibility , four eng@@ ines , lots of op@@ tions .
it &apos;s just a tiny percentage of it that &apos;s ever going to be able to grow by thousands of times , and it turns out thousands of times as long as the cultural moment .
part of hi@@ pp@@ ie , part of yo@@ g@@ i , divi@@ des broo@@ kl@@ a -- i don &apos;t know .
and it was my job to stop every night , until their alp@@ ines came up , so i could pass them up .
it also turns out , as a lot of more sophisti@@ cated , as the ter@@ min@@ ology has de@@ vot@@ ed , as a result of the ter@@ min@@ ology .
and i want to talk about how to think about how democracy could look like , or you could have seen the mothers more involved if we wanted to compe@@ te mothers more .
of course there &apos;s some major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of it -- chr@@ onic spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries .
and so much of the only possibility -- if it &apos;s a brain b@@ loo@@ d@@ line or whether it &apos;s a little bit of a brain , or the wheel@@ chair -- the wheel@@ chair .
you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet us and to disc@@ uss them and to disc@@ uss them with them .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden lau@@ gh that the trees re@@ main .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to give you some unique recor@@ dings out of the wil@@ der@@ ness .
i met people in all their lives , so many of them did what they loved , they lived on the bor@@ ders of the possible .
i realized that by showing the points , that there is only a great father of being a great dad .
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell you what i &apos;ve pac@@ ka@@ ged in this exciting week at ted .
and if you want to re@@ de@@ fy it , if you want to re@@ pair the sy@@ r@@ inge , you can actually get the roof down .
and here you can see me , when i was trying to test the mel@@ ting , the water , not to get we@@ t .
but then , if you have all the points , you can play with it , and with color and turn movement .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , and we knew , and we knew that they ought to be in a ho@@ y .
after a four@@ -year-old and film sa@@ ga gli@@ tt , a boat re@@ f@@ ers to the la@@ ke as a fishing boat .
next year when it was done in 2004 , you could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ ought for four months to four months .
there was a crazy head@@ line about that in this country , which is nothing more involved in this country that there &apos;s no way that you have mis@@ use .
in fact , the media is leading us to show us negative subje@@ cts , because our minds seem to have these subje@@ cts attention .
my hot state of al@@ ab@@ ama &apos;s re@@ moved from the vot@@ ing right , if you &apos;re crimin@@ ally con@@ vi@@ cted .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i teach my students afri@@ can@@ -@@ american history , i talk about sla@@ very .
i &apos;m talking about terror@@ ism , the time for the end of the re@@ construction , except to the beginning of the world war .
if we don &apos;t care about that , with these difficult subje@@ cts , the positive and wonderful things also are affected .
but ultimately , that reali@@ ties of suffering , ab@@ use , ab@@ use , separ@@ ation , separ@@ ation .
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to tell me is that you &apos;re going to never drink al@@ al@@ hol drink . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i watched you . &quot;
so four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil and i here at ted has a new university , which is &quot; sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university . &quot;
this is why the p@@ ace of the beach &apos;s assem@@ bly has been made al@@ umin@@ um in al@@ umin@@ um .
the truth is nobody knows what a good surge@@ on or a doctor or a doctor &apos;s assi@@ stant .
i gave her medicine , which we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water tab@@ lets , so they make the liquid .
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think that &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m standing here that i never have a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : it &apos;s only about the past , or is it about the future ?
this slide shows a piece of data from an analy@@ sis of the power of ris@@ ky process@@ ors for the performance of a local network .
either it &apos;s going to be a classi@@ c cur@@ ve like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
and yes , i &apos;ve even put the house up on the top of the island to make it look dis@@ orders .
it works very simple , every time i jum@@ ped on the scale , send my data on google health .
and chicago she has just introduced to the people who get the bu@@ re@@ ger ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship when it sta@@ ys .
it &apos;s how the government could work better -- not much more like a private company , how many people think they should think that she should be .
now there &apos;s a large community of people who are making resources that we need to put things down effectively .
but in one particular way , you can use something that looks still three-@@ dimensional , as if it could exist .
here at ted to be here at ted , and listening to how stimul@@ ating this is , i gave a lot of force to me .
so we are the am@@ uses , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell we &apos;re actually doing here .
it became a gol@@ di@@ er access to a world full of pi@@ ra@@ c@@ tors and in@@ ju@@ red ships in my imagination .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling , the re@@ a@@ ders of the world .
i don &apos;t mean the ma@@ gi@@ cian and dra@@ kit@@ s , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we have all had as children .
and this is why each book and every world has a little mar@@ m that i put here to the ma@@ gical device in the device .
are we going to have a society in order to di@@ vi@@ te and uni@@ for@@ g@@ ant , or bu@@ more and stuff ?
in a blood continent , these people were the only one who never re@@ covered from the spa@@ in .
one second option is that it will be a sense of traditional as of the traditional kind of , of course , of course , of the cro@@ ws of nature .
and we have the lin@@ ear@@ ity as a bill accep@@ ted , and there &apos;s only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
you &apos;re bus@@ y , you &apos;re starting to engage in the day of perception and the per@@ cep@@ tual sy@@ ch@@ ology .
there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the united states , which tries to make bio@@ fuel , so fuel from al@@ ga@@ e .
so each one of the time you &apos;ve been blo@@ wn up a sou@@ p , which has left too long , you already did .
so another project made from the french group there in paris , which worked out , that &apos;s pretty cool .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that again , and i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about trial that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
we don &apos;t even think of the thing in pictures of things , but we di@@ fy it for our language .
a plan , america back to work , make sure make sure , and to help us stop the global warming .
when i heard this story , the way i was working with was a little bit of the way i worked , and it already saved me .
but this is an essential compon@@ ent compon@@ ent , if you put things that are incredibly intui@@ tive .
so , the cities had to grow more , because farmers went to the city and continu@@ ing the cities and continue to catch their nutri@@ ents on their nutri@@ ents .
and the great thing is that the crimin@@ al rate of the fa@@ vel@@ as to the fa@@ vel@@ as to about nin@@ et@@ y .
you think of yourself in this time , for example of the temporary images , or liter@@ ature reading .
i &apos;m playing the piece of every few years , and it has moved to me every few years , and it has moved to me , even though none of the single grade has changed .
and you can put these notes into the united ent@@ ary , which you can put in any sort of spo@@ ts in any pattern .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what if i can &apos;t sing me ?
they &apos;re off@@ ered 50 invest@@ ments -- 10 percent less employees , they care about five percent less than if they would deliver them five . why ?
and what we found was 30 er@@ r@@ ors , when we put the original sequence , would never have been able to go on it .
the suffering of ti@@ bet@@ a can be un@@ toler@@ ant , but the land@@ ing spirit of people is something un@@ thin@@ ned .
now you know , the in@@ u@@ it is not terri@@ bly afraid of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the gli@@ mp@@ ses of their terrible ones were made out of fish in carto@@ i skin .
the more choices , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have .
we can put 6@@ .@@ 5 million different fac@@ es together with the components that are off@@ ered in this one business .
i think that the b@@ ach would have been happy if he had the sound of the present way of present today .
and how do we deal with it in relation to the relationship , but in the contr@@ ary ways to keep ourselves in intellectual health ?
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billions of oil of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million of them a day .
we have technology now because of this fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ology metho@@ ds to do what we call combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er said a little bit about his last interview : each one of my books had a little wi@@ der .
the ro@@ man had the same idea , called this kind of body lo@@ se@@ m of creativity .
she came up with the po@@ em in his tail and put it back into her body and put it back into her body .
a child who doesn &apos;t know the sing@@ ing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by itself .
not change and technology , the integri@@ ty of no@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . the ug@@ ly face of the leadership .
if i let this stage , i don &apos;t have : : 1 speaking , and + 1 nu@@ t idea , + 20 crazy idea .
they have more information about the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other artic@@ ul@@ on in each other &apos;s artic@@ ul@@ ated version of the world .
there are questions about the people that we believed that they would always have been right . so be skep@@ tical .
a color@@ ful cap@@ su@@ le , which is at the end , and on the other hand , is better than a white burn .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not useful anymore because we apply it too too many different things .
and , by the way , we &apos;re now im@@ stan@@ able to get a fairly good idea about the happiness of the living self over time .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century , we have to increase this time dra@@ matically .
these are the energy far@@ ms , you &apos;re talking about lots of squ@@ ar@@ es , thousands of squ@@ ar@@ es , a thousand times higher than a normal power plant .
almost all the manufacturing method for power is em@@ it@@ ted today , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy .
so he says it &apos;s completely logi@@ cal that number more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of global re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation , which took almost 20 years , which could explain the fam@@ ine .
i would like to tell you a little bit about what i was writing a couple of months ago in writing of article .
and i want to leave you with the impact , which is the most difficult of the bat of one person .
in the 196@@ 0s , in britain , a case study was done at the same time , the gy@@ m@@ n@@ ine was conver@@ ted in total schools .
vin@@ o@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest in do@@ zens of sh@@ ops in do@@ zens of sh@@ ops , and the interesting opportunities , and i try to support it .
but only those who are still in school -- except from the students who had s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed at school .
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fishing me@@ ds , and then he said , chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the earth . &quot;
it &apos;s only interested in itself to be self-@@ interest in the need to prove to prove that there &apos;s predic@@ t@@ ell@@ ers .
i have to say , you know , you did it , it dro@@ pped out of me , it &apos;s hard to talk to me about my idea .
that &apos;s in the small scale , so you can also use your car to your as@@ s@@ ert on a little touch in your car .
you &apos;re going to have to go on to a seas@@ onal memory and w@@ winter summer and not only equal night .
robert gor@@ p@@ ta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stol@@ en the c@@ -@@ dig@@ its of dig@@ ni@@ ty .
do that , for example , if you meet a person who you can say , there &apos;s no predic@@ t@@ ant speak@@ ers .
but in the art and studying , we need to fail to be an alternative , because they guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed it in a tru@@ ck .
i said , &quot; mi@@ c@@ el , flies 2@@ 40 miles down the farm and fly 2@@ 40 miles on the night ?
one billion -- that &apos;s more than any time before -- because of the pre@@ ten@@ se un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ties in the distribution , not the total production system .
we &apos;re thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by our cor@@ n@@ els today , not because of the bar@@ gain of resources , but because of the exten@@ sion of resources .
nobody had the intern@@ al inside of the w@@ re@@ t@@ are . they had no resources for them . so we developed the technology .
for me , it was more tools to do my job , the actual process , which has changed in the form .
it &apos;s the one who says you don &apos;t care about what you &apos;ve done , but you care about yourself .
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service and my che@@ e@@ ine asked me to have a conversation in her office .
and the reason is changing -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft cor@@ als , mat@@ ch@@ as@@ m .
there are several well-@@ known cases of online species , multi@@ cent , which made their money on attack .
so , all you need to do is create a blue and a green one , and you can build much more rapi@@ dly .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , this micro@@ phone -- all at some time impossible .
and i kept asking time to be wa@@ sted for meaning@@ less things , and i &apos;ve wa@@ ited with people who mean something .
or regul@@ arly , in three dimensions , when it turns to what changes , the light is not the position of sculp@@ ting .
here you can see a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ re-@@ controll@@ er , which is sort of like a smo@@ oth v .
and in fact , we &apos;ve passed seven progra@@ mm@@ ers out of the world -- literally all out of all cor@@ ners of the world -- to us home .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks at life support system .
at the end of sand@@ , he gave us an email with following content : &quot; for first time , i &apos;ve recor@@ ded something .
and basically , it &apos;s a system which has made out of two parts -- a sense of sen@@ sation and a sense of re@@ actor end@@ less@@ ly .
but the more i thought about his question , so that i thought it could give a little women in fe@@ min@@ ism .
and after we &apos;ve been experim@@ enting with several different types of che@@ ese , i told myself that this is a tar@@ ge@@ ted attack .
so after what we were looking for , we were syste@@ tic@@ -@@ func@@ tion@@ ing , because we know what those eff@@ or@@ ts were about .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed -- like this strange bear , which is still brothers .
we &apos;re going to be sc@@ or@@ ing both for men and for women -- well , ro@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
all these things come from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical illu@@ stration of water and the proje@@ ctions of water and the proje@@ ctions .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t care -- but i didn &apos;t care , but i had too many muse@@ ums and those art@@ work as well .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save the lives of a human , but every day for us to change an opportunity to change one .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is a x chromo@@ some , which hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ gs .
if you de@@ vote the game , you get off the world bank , which is &quot; social , &quot; gradu@@ ally , 2010 .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our im@@ pris@@ on@@ ers and our great ad@@ head , a connection .
now let &apos;s look at the wheel@@ cha@@ ir@@ -@@ lap@@ -@@ bo@@ und , something that i really passionate about .
i was 24 years old , and in pol@@ lin@@ ators , as a mon@@ str@@ ous fli@@ p@@ tree fli@@ pp@@ ed during a sk@@ et@@ ro@@ wing ride .
we put our esti@@ mates out outside the home , where , not surpris@@ ingly , he got more attention than mine .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i , mom@@ a , who &apos;s the ri@@ j@@ s , the van go@@ gh , the van go@@ gh .
since years , because i &apos;ve been interested in sexual sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in gender .
now , they did that because they were part of an in@@ her@@ it@@ an system in which two things grew up .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other side , he &apos;s born on a mar@@ g@@ in , in 19@@ 80 , born .
so we have this dur@@ able an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories , in many ways , proble@@ matic and frag@@ onal .
in our eff@@ or@@ ts for democracy , we &apos;ve made it really good , and i think we would be doing our thing in the future good .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political as@@ y@@ l , rather than having an operation to separate them ? &quot;
and we went into school distri@@ cts , where companies are going to travel their way into the schools , in all america .
so , they sent half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i take my 21 billion game hours per week .
during the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er who was trou@@ bled , that the jan@@ it@@ ors were in court .
here in california , for example , in the next five years , there &apos;s a billion dollars on death pen@@ al@@ ty , a billion dollars .
so this communication was allowed to create the communities that were in a sense of the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ -@@ table .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in a more complicated cases .
we talked about that , that nothing changed since the time of the old indian indian po@@ ri@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
the other way is , did anyone deser@@ ve a cri@@ mes of death , but : did we deser@@ ve it ?
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than when we don &apos;t care about it .
now the average age of our field is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , a generation older than most of you .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve arrived at the conclu@@ sion that it came to occu@@ p@@ y , to go out of it .
and if you look for your smart phone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clin@@ ton 15 years ago .
and i learned in my little da@@ wn in the si@@ ft@@ an general hospital , un@@ far from here .
other medical admini@@ stration is that , but the emergen@@ cy medical care is very special because we only look at the patients like this .
my third little story talks about my collabor@@ ator at the ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence of the ar@@ ter@@ ship in southern asia .
i dro@@ ve up on that , and we made it out of southern southern southern sea and particularly in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e sea in and especially in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and they realize that the future is still in 2000 .
ok , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to one single single result . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
and the fe@@ a@@ thers were broken up english from people who had one thing shared : they started recor@@ ding .
my mother was star@@ ving out every night , but we were told each other of our day , and listen@@ ed to the following of our grandmother in the house .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to build this one as a swi@@ mming pool and this thing .
imagine half of the people who want to live in a@@ partment , they already have this ; the other half didn &apos;t yet .
and the more we pick them , the better we &apos;ll be able to use the art of choice .
last year , vas@@ vas@@ que@@ z , this video , he had shot in front of his house in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
my mother ma@@ i was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two little girls .
very simply , they go into -- and i &apos;ve made this , which is the power of the zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om around .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at colle@@ c@@ tors in the collective action with digital technology .
there was a power of energy , an un@@ likely optimis@@ m of the de@@ coura@@ ge and the wa@@ g@@ g@@ ant .
i was bald in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died , 1@@ 000 miles away from mel@@ ting .
i see them as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you take different pieces and put together , to create an alternative reality .
and those two pictures have taken these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- out of the same al@@ titude , and the same ligh@@ ting mode .
the other thing that we want to ask , is that companies in the world are helping us at the con@@ fir@@ m of this a@@ is@@ e@@ ds .
we &apos;ve done this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been following them since the last three years .
and this is a symbol of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it , and all the people in the world .
according to the har@@ ib@@ c@@ us , gam@@ ling games , in the king@@ dom ly@@ ri@@ des , in the king@@ dom ly@@ ri@@ di@@ as in a fam@@ ine .
they don &apos;t have le@@ f@@ -@@ land maps , but they used to have these kinds of gl@@ ines using son@@ ines , or er@@ ap@@ ar@@ ing .
and those are over the cent@@ u@@ ries of cent@@ u@@ ries , and more and more over@@ -@@ sig@@ ned by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at the university of al@@ as@@ ka , with another flat la@@ ke of the winter .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways of old , hum@@ bling power plants , that make up our world to reduce them .
he &apos;s got this kind of light there , and in the co@@ operating co@@ operation with the museum , which is the laun@@ ch of the museum .
they go in the spirit through this house , and they look at how many do@@ ors there are .
in this head , you know , in this brain , you know , and mi@@ th@@ n@@ ine , that kind of virtual images , had been passed up .
and maybe again , somebody will never name god &apos;s name , but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
the artists of aging was prote@@ cted by things , like , for example , too nar@@ cis@@ s@@ co@@ s@@ m , right ?
and this is tar@@ ge@@ ted to me that i &apos;m explor@@ ing the outside world , so i re@@ cover the real world .
not when i think of local e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , and the neighb@@ or is less e@@ col@@ o@@ gical , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
and what does it mean , of course , intui@@ tively , how do we work and how do the cognitive process@@ ing process works ?
so a lot of natural , in a ves@@ sel , but i sort of look at exactly where is sal@@ z and pe@@ pp@@ ers in it .
so , a very intri@@ gu@@ ing process , how certain things are going to happen , and in a milli@@ on-@@ second areas , these things happen .
this is called a ras@@ er@@ ial water , five years old , almost like blood that fli@@ ves out of the body here .
and this tells someone like al gore , which is one of our great hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing to stabili@@ ze than human popu@@ lations .
this is the off@@ ic@@ al do@@ g@@ ma that is one that we think of all of us right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , whose problem is not to have a huge choice .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
and what she found was a 10 invest@@ ments of the emplo@@ yer , took the participa@@ tion to 2 percent .
and the more you have , the more basic it is to re@@ gre@@ t at anything that is de@@ ception to choice that you meet .
but a very important point that he is doing is , whenever you &apos;re interested in one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do anything else .
and so this is the picture that it comes to us generally , obje@@ ctive , and we feel worse about ourselves .
you &apos;ve made g@@ dp civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;re always able to get the nutri@@ ents back .
for example , they get to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t care that they pass this success ?
finally , reading out this carto@@ on , and , a high-@@ tech person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish mean ?
phan@@ tom is a short view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
we have problems with food , with fo@@ cal and clean water , medicine , fu@@ els for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
now , the engineers will look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
in one of the connections between a thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a man@@ ual tur@@ ca@@ pe@@ d@@ ment .
that makes everybody all the time , but he does it un@@ conscious , and , in part , very instin@@ ctive , too , very instin@@ ctive .
it &apos;s an amazing example of how a nation , a state , a state , the re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tation with his in@@ hab@@ its and reach .
several years ago at ted , here at ted , peter sc@@ ill@@ man had a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
but you know , this is really a serious business , because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we give billions of dollars for it .
what came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated software interface that has ever been able to see in a film .
this is what happens when you try to say this inter@@ rup@@ ting sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of consumption .
development has heard in this industry a lot of time , so it &apos;s not a surprise that some good concep@@ ts lying around .
and if you put ocean water , you get enough gra@@ pes , you get enough fuel for the rest of life .
you know , we don &apos;t know about their work as well as those , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ul@@ ari@@ ars , which is another approach .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single wi@@ di@@ as@@ et and re@@ constru@@ cted it in a small sum@@ mary .
we love wee@@ ken@@ ds . we love little family facili@@ ties -- we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat local food . we eat bi@@ o .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not wor@@ thy , and we need to really stop it .
but despite all this ti@@ de of work , there are multiple cognitive dis@@ orders that are sort of impossible to impossible , right thinking about happiness .
and the surprise is that patient is a much worse remin@@ der of the inte@@ st@@ ine , as a patient b .
and yet , somehow you get the impres@@ sion that what happens in the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws of life is our lives in the back of the life .
that &apos;s not as easy to have this feeling that at a finger@@ age of h@@ ung@@ s , people are willing to stand up .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner , to create stories with my need , to create pictures .
but to see it in the context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0,000 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to go along .
we need to have this gap , which is the de@@ ception , which is the de@@ ception , without which we can &apos;t be alive .
we don &apos;t only have the art in the art , but in the acade@@ mic di@@ ets , we have such great lie lying as well .
so , if i invi@@ te you to eat and say , this is free of chicken , then helps you do it .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t pro@@ pag@@ ate , and what you can &apos;t do is not sam@@ ples , and what you don &apos;t care about .
over time , they get more infe@@ ctions , and they would even taste a little bit more .
the artists share with you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , which we can use as a great invention of stabili@@ zing our lives .
this is not about making the exi@@ sting one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish -- a farm that meas@@ ures your success .
now again , we can bring back the second sentence , and say , if wol@@ f sing@@ er has right , he has no responsibility for freedom .
and to get to this purpose , people are going to come and look at our experiment@@ al level , sort of the in@@ trin@@ si@@ st@@ ence .
he talked about her passion , and a understanding that i would only know about my colleagues in phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
and then he goes and flo@@ ws in more of rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and al@@ ga@@ e water plants .
and yet , when i put them in this restaurant in southern southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t even s@@ wal@@ low into fish skin .
we put the past , which people don &apos;t understand , because the standards have changed and very low .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re interested in the building block of our time for experts , and therefore i decided to change that .
when we started to put our research , six months ago , it was completely popular what the meaning and purpose of this structure was .
and we also stru@@ ck that they were very profession@@ ally designed by people who obviously had all of the pres@@ ence of information available .
and you can tell him about it , and he &apos;s opening up to let you pass it , how you can see on this picture .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achie@@ ved some things .
in my own humanity , and with my dis@@ se@@ min@@ ged , i would say , better to be better in everything i did .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion of an exhi@@ bi@@ tion , the pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ i for mom@@ a later in a year , while summer , organized , organized .
you &apos;ve got a fe@@ der@@ al under@@ wear under the nose , and if you were moving , you haven &apos;t bu@@ ried them .
anyway , what we found is that both digital explo@@ it@@ ks in reality were actually a and the same obje@@ ctive , but from different direc@@ tions .
r@@ al@@ ph , it became a lot of repor@@ ts that people assu@@ me that the mo@@ s@@ ses of the whole organization behind them .
so one of the intui@@ tions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be at the same time at the same time .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like any at@@ om out there to either at@@ om out there , a sen@@ sor and an oper@@ ator .
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch is the new port , which was built in den@@ ver .
h@@ ein@@ rich has to wait for all this , because it actually has another biological age , just because of the time of his birth .
so , immediately , the online ad@@ v@@ ance of 2009 came up and expect that i &apos;m going to talk to you about this .
for example , one of the people who have an ei@@ ght-@@ hour child , could pass them out and lab@@ ori@@ ble them and lab@@ pl@@ ed them up .

and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to get less than a mass mass in virtual worl@@ ds and online game environments . &quot;
there was such a fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ es became a crazy idea of expla@@ ining a crazy idea .
if i ask you a question , put up , because i &apos;m blind , only hand , if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
typically , the system in the idea is that a particular an@@ atom@@ ical au@@ o@@ pe with a particular identity .
i was going to go back to the bottom , where i am at the door of my pe@@ e@@ my and the belo@@ ved dog .
this is just a little pre@@ ference to the insi@@ ghts , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s us in our past and present .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the kinds of kinds of things about gender vari@@ ants who don &apos;t have the male or a female standard .
it has the ability to be in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it requires a slightly bit of help to do it .
and if you do it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked that you &apos;re actually able to do this kind of stuff . this is an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that management incre@@ ases , and it &apos;s also working on an ex@@ ternal legal system .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we put those er@@ r@@ ors out of medicine , that a sa@@ fer system rema@@ ins us .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how someone could do something like this , and how much the freedom would be the freedom of freedom .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent de@@ ck@@ end@@ rate rate of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 20@@ 13 .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how the protein is going to evol@@ ve .
however , what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re involved in each of you , including the world to be perfect in the world .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; they &apos;re law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and as we speak today , in 2011 , the governments like governments , it &apos;s quite the right that we give , for forever .
they put us into the able to build things bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , a rock after another .
le@@ go actually put the em@@ ph@@ ent block , the building block of the world , and made it a building for our imagination .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet with 5@@ 0,000 times more energy than we use every year .
well , it seems to me , this top@@ ic , or should least be the most interesting political deb@@ tions about the next few years .
and as humans , we have a lot better to look at problems in a very long way , but they ultimately over@@ come it .
do we really think that we reach what we need to reach , without making it an institution in the names of us ?
in any way that we don &apos;t understand , this dro@@ p@@ let is learning information to information .
third , it &apos;s not possible to make it possible , where the individual images begin and end by the end .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced at the bi@@ b@@ pole university was a major listen@@ er to do .
and then i decided to use the ap@@ p to get the ap@@ p to get the resi@@ dents to get rid of the sti@@ cks .
but it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how they can be done on a two-@@ dimensional scale .
and then he took a drink of be@@ er and off@@ ered my sister &apos;s sister , and she &apos;d as@@ sum@@ ed , and then they care about me .
they &apos;ve learned to collect the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , and in one particular chemical form that we call dna .
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s made out of random in@@ struc@@ tions .
and if i say no , she embra@@ ched me back . if i say , &quot; i said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; let me go quie@@ t .
we &apos;re going to get more into play in space . i mean , in relation to the mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions , to do something meaning@@ ful to work together .
all these people are teaching us that there are other ways of living opportunities , different ways of doing different ways of acting on earth .
but it &apos;s always about trying to find such a lo@@ ck@@ y way , such a play@@ ful process so that you have a play@@ ful co@@ verage .
that was fairly intui@@ tive , so everybody just has so his wi@@ sh@@ es , and that , and what it &apos;s moving on , and what it does is .
he can bring new characters to the scene by putting the si@@ st@@ able from the table , which shows this character .
and i don &apos;t need to do it in the field , but can impro@@ v@@ ise ; they t@@ we@@ ak them ; they like the mean@@ while or s@@ wir@@ ses .
and finally , i can finish the whole sequence by appl@@ ying the lou@@ dest tag to the left .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of carbon dio@@ xide -- 25 million tons a day in the oceans .
it &apos;s just an aging mortality of a lot of pain@@ ful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he will never go back into those higher .
arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive mod@@ t@@ ings , is that the models that we &apos;ve engine@@ ered in the pre-@@ industrial times .
we had the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary age , and we had the machine age and we kind of decided to describe cyber@@ -@@ age .
and on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , and i &apos;m hop@@ ing that there &apos;s no sugar in it , which is the s@@ alt .
so , for christ@@ mas , in my home , in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of coal co@@ il .
there are a product l@@ ing@@ n@@ ine , which is so form@@ alized things , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ es@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ tical aspe@@ cts .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers all over the world have been in a really extraordinary way , and previ@@ ously , in the world .
one-@@ income distribution will be that it &apos;s all going to be better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices make us .
and by getting out the wir@@ es of e@@ ase and 13@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half thousand , suddenly electr@@ onic resi@@ stance of electr@@ onic resi@@ stance .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states , and the doctor tells you what to do .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re bus@@ y with other things , wondering yourself , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i get married ?
nobody in the world knows this , because , if you would , you all know what it is about it .
i &apos;ll get all the over@@ all picture now , and i can say , show me all the story of cho@@ col@@ ate .
maybe we can &apos;t er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate this from 500 years to the human human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
and even those who don &apos;t actually care about the fact that su@@ i@@ ci@@ cide has been really ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted by their tal@@ ents .
do you feel comfortable ? because with only one tent@@ h of it -- i feel comfortable with this as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment at all .
for the first time in the history , people have a geni@@ us called a geni@@ us , instead of , that he has a geni@@ us .
i &apos;ve got cognitive re@@ plac@@ toi@@ ation , and you &apos;ve got a pro@@ vo@@ il , what you want to see .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ ine of a animal age of 40 of the time , and deter@@ mine , which animal species of this .
there we are more likely to be at the symbo@@ lic level , which we care about as an old level of course .
i &apos;m going to open my hand up , and hopefully , if everything is fine , the kni@@ fe will be measu@@ red by my si@@ gh@@ ted body magne@@ tis@@ m .
i &apos;m going to stick this need@@ le into my skin and put it through it , until you pass it on the other side .
and peter talks : &quot; none of the kids invest in che@@ f of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
and one of them is that despite all of our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people in the world go to bed h@@ ung@@ ri@@ g bed every day .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works -- this is a trick that has been at least since the 195@@ 0s in each ma@@ gi@@ or of the 195@@ 0s .
they actually go through it and create a frame@@ work in which this wide can be discus@@ sed , because we need to support all sides .
there were people who were dying , we had the oceans really well , and on the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a transpor@@ tation .
and the one that was worse is where the pain was at the bottom , it &apos;s a terrible story .
we know happiness means to be satis@@ fied with people who like us , time to spend time with people we like to spend time for people who like us .
if you ask this question , people in california have to be happ@@ ier when they say , in o@@ hi@@ o lives .
if the ab@@ str@@ i you recei@@ ve , a very high amount of energy is , you can only get the rich th@@ ol@@ ars .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is gener@@ ally a fund like seriously taking and based on that of politics ?
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we might get a redu@@ ction to a factor , or maybe even a factor factor .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to make music in this way , and you &apos;ve experienced it as the audience , like music .
the artist will share with you in such a portra@@ it with something that you &apos;re all going to be familiar with when you look at this art@@ work over and over again .
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on earth , they wei@@ gh the ants around four times more than humans .
because if you take these no@@ as , you squ@@ at@@ ter , ster@@ ili@@ sel@@ s and pul@@ se , to get trees to plant trees .
it has to be , for me , and now it may be , i don &apos;t convince my audience to convince me that this is my subject .
if we think of the wei@@ gh until the ba@@ thro@@ w , then our whole earth used to be , or later a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful .
according to th@@ ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , &quot; you know , the law is an advanced technology , &quot; sp@@ an &#93; no longer to each other .
one day the head of the company , and said , &quot; if i could put in an event for the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
so i put him down . i said , &quot; mi@@ che@@ el , how does it come that your fish ta@@ stes so well ? &quot;
you could say that it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future , whether we talk bar@@ bar@@ or or meat c@@ attle .
take the switch out to be a pul@@ ul@@ l that is here , and they have a little blind bi@@ as .
if you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg mountain , you think you &apos;re very easy to be isol@@ ated , separate and alone , just as people often see us .
the third thing that i learned about -- this is the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; to count .
some of you will remember it as a it@@ al@@ y of fr@@ ance , and then at the end , the head turn .
now , this is just an example of how we feel today the city , in a way that we can &apos;t feel a few years ago .
the cloud is a cloud of points , in the same way as a cloud cloud of particles .
sometimes people tell me , i would say , as if i d@@ ress , or that i remember it in your se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
my circle started in the 196@@ 0s in sto@@ v , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class@@ ines .
we have a lot of very difficult dis@@ plac@@ ements -- maybe not as public as in the medical sci@@ ences in medicine -- the question when somebody &apos;s dead .
something i believe is that , if you pass your chance of taking risk , that in these kinds of risks you &apos;re going to fit in these kinds of ways .
so i pro@@ posed that governments can create new spaces that provide enough space for a city and give them a name : char@@ ter cities .
she grew up at a time where con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ism is the social nor@@ m and local mand@@ ar@@ in to the most important person .
i just want to mention , by the way , that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives in there .
and down to today , we don &apos;t only want to be as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called , but as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
so to tell you about this ten@@ sion , i have to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
so we have a bigger game for the next world &apos;s next game , and it &apos;s a bigger goal of oil .
look , it really takes one person who demon@@ strate how they repli@@ cate how they repli@@ cate , and they &apos;re mani@@ pul@@ ated by it .
here &apos;s a back@@ bone forma@@ tion , to put this on the right . you know all of the wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki of the world .
we should get over@@ come that half of us spend an hour per day playing with games until we solved the problems of the real world .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i &apos;ve been designing to try and make people seem an epi@@ stra@@ il in their own future .
and this is a news that we need to use this guy on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic kur@@ s in the field of technology .
the call to sign up , we &apos;ve made almost like a jer@@ ry g@@ ck@@ -@@ he@@ ater film film .
and if you look at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at play , you see the evolutionary roots of human la@@ ch@@ ens , dan@@ cing and ritu@@ als .
suppose i told you that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory of memory could be -- pre@@ cis@@ ely , more and faster .
i came to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , in las v@@ eg@@ as his show in the 9@@ 0s .
soldi@@ er , with the h@@ ul@@ c@@ -@@ ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds across various ter@@ rain , many hours long .
or photographs like this -- dark and color@@ ful , but all with the common goal , a reali@@ stic level of keeping a reali@@ stic level .
an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result that &apos;s so much more positive that they didn &apos;t even know that it was done at all .
and the next post that we &apos;ve got , &quot; i went over there , found the g@@ arb@@ age sound behind the house .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is about a million times less and less thousand times smaller than a super@@ computer of the 7@@ 0s .
and just by the way , the biggest in@@ sur@@ ance against a population explosion is a better way of living and nutri@@ tion in the world .
when i put the sta@@ irs down to the dis@@ h , there was an el@@ der@@ ly black man , the jan@@ it@@ ors in the court .
it tou@@ ched something very deep in me , identity , the ability of individual , something to a community of hope .
the rich@@ est chap@@ ters of the last century , has never been able to have such lux@@ ury dre@@ am@@ ers of the earth .
i also think in many parts of this country , and with safety in parts of the world , the opposite of poverty don &apos;t travel .
the head of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just sent a big test project with hundreds of un@@ its in the developing world .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hop@@ es , more commit@@ ment , more commit@@ ting , in a complex world .
there &apos;s a lot of things , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s only 14 patients per night .
on the y-@@ axis is a couple of good things : bio@@ diversity , number number , number of or@@ ca , the green supply of its country , the water supply .
so , for example , the people who are seeing a marine reser@@ ve and the insi@@ ghts of the insi@@ ghts that allow us to re@@ cover their levels of values .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up , and i didn &apos;t know whether i was just dre@@ am@@ t by this crazy post or actually wrote it .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-@@ being , and i &apos;m hop@@ ing to give you a sense of how hard it is .
i gave my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and said , &quot; h@@ mm . go@@ h . go@@ b@@ ble . go@@ b@@ ble . go@@ b@@ ble . go@@ b@@ ble . go@@ b@@ ble . &quot;
so the nervous system actually has the evolutionary process of using this particular informa@@ tional equipment because of the evolution now , now within an individual .
i &apos;m afraid i could lose the capacity , the sun@@ sets , with no camera and t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
because i think this really matters , we need to step back and look at the thing in a longer time scale .
and the amazing thing about this is that the kind of information of information is about five billion years of time in which it came to be the same .
at this point , we have several thou@@ sand@@ -@@ based communities , communities in many different cell types of cells , which are put together as a single organis@@ m .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
we use these programs to do a lot of quickly , so that we can do those processes , so that we can run those processes even more quickly .
and after the terror@@ ism , the ras@@ ras@@ ses came out and decades of fin@@ e-@@ motiv@@ ated under@@ valu@@ ation , and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and so i gave myself to the world of technology to see how i could use them to make it funny , rather than killing .
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; no , you don &apos;t care about it because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
we have a local system in this country , which is a much much better treat if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and gu@@ il@@ ty .
and the players believe that there is an epi@@ mor@@ e@@ ous vic@@ tim , and it &apos;s always starting to try to try and try it , and that &apos;s the same .
every language is like an ol@@ d-@@ class forest of the spirit , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem spi@@ ritual .
and we even tried to re@@ cover it in the acade@@ mic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
sh@@ am@@ an@@ e , pri@@ est , so-@@ called science la@@ d@@ wat@@ ers , were doing things for them to be able to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design world and some of the possibility of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
computers ha@@ ck , and then it turns into the media as well , yes , the ha@@ cker break somewhere in a place and cla@@ ws data and so forth .
right there on the left is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , hou@@ se-@@ fu@@ el@@ ing fo@@ ods , which is , you know , there &apos;s already been a long time .
in the hi@@ hi@@ a@@ ya , the third largest ice mass , you see new la@@ kes , a few years ago .
so i think we &apos;re in the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene in which we &apos;re actually a step further than the acade@@ mic world .
is it that someone should be expected to be afraid of having the work to do it ?
now , of course , this is completely ab@@ and@@ y , because we look at one side of the new media , l social media , facebook and so forth .
so , all the people who are here are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
every day , they give you a strong about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day you have to take two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
these are some kids coming up on a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try it out and put a video of it .
he has transl@@ ated the se@@ ero@@ chs , just as he saw , as you saw in this moment .
she knew that in a moment , only one could do , and that was -- in her words -- race like the de@@ vil .
i want to say -- a shor@@ t@@ cut bi@@ ograph@@ y moment -- i &apos;m married by a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little bit better than no , but it does not follow the more choice than something .
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 molecules with full ter@@ mond and you sing them in a different clay .
this is , i think , as deep in our water@@ supply , that there would be no way to get to question .
and the answer is : you expect to call us the doctor in the next morning , and to ask a change of pres@@ cri@@ ption .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything that an orche@@ str@@ a of the time is un@@ comfortable .
if hundreds of different types of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one de@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
in min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 0,000 degrees , as much as the rooms between the stars , these wir@@ es can stop the ten@@ sion .
but it &apos;s a reci@@ pe with a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ d glass glass , and i sus@@ pe@@ ct , disaster .
in other words , when we saw this image 10@@ th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
about a week in the machine , what happened to do with these wir@@ es -- this golden gold ur@@ t here .
i want to leave you with what i &apos;m going to say to you about now , so these kinds of things that we &apos;re interpre@@ ting to , in a verb@@ al language .
and then you ask them how to do their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought , &quot; i thought i had some of these plants .
what happens when you play a piece of today , which is origin@@ ally a hundred or a half thousand years ago ?
so we need a great break@@ through , something that is going to be a factor of a 100 100 , which is a factor of a factor of 100 .
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ cy -- first of all , you can give us an idea of scale on the scale of this investment ?
there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing it for you . don &apos;t make you yourself yourself , not against yourself , but take risks to you . &quot;
only different econom@@ ical changes have at all , and we need to reduce from ra@@ pid increase and down to zero .
so , if you &apos;re on these sources , you have to have a way , which is also available in time you don &apos;t care .
my response to that was drawing and painting of ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , space centers , and all that .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i give you a company who &apos;s been following , maybe surprise , the nuclear re@@ view .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community dis@@ ru@@ pt , so in the way .
dis@@ orders about this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where vac@@ cin@@ ators sin@@ k in mas@@ ses .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we figure out that they &apos;re effective .
and how we consu@@ me it clearly seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that re@@ f@@ ers the re@@ all for us .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction of my childhood .
so the impli@@ cation of what i said here is that we shouldn &apos;t really imagine when a re@@ plac@@ ement of well-@@ being .
and when it &apos;s fighting through the system , and this leaves , the water is cle@@ aner , as it came from .
if we turn that asi@@ de off , you didn &apos;t have those ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain den@@ sity in the net .
he had just had a pres@@ ence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and four@@ ter sym@@ on@@ ony and came along the stage to me .
and if we &apos;re in fr@@ ance here in fr@@ ance , i remember the ma@@ x-@@ plan@@ ary institute for brain research .
and we just have a relatively simple in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ce to ask , where could you possibly use an memory meaning@@ ful today .
we can start to integra@@ te electric mo@@ bility already , ru@@ m@@ bling questions , can you be able to do the bur@@ den .
and not only in the art , in the tex@@ ting sm@@ ells , in the my@@ th@@ ology , in stories show up .
if you don &apos;t have that , this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , then you have to replace it with the supp@@ le@@ ments .
and no , he doesn &apos;t co@@ ok fish , and it &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least the way you and i understand it .
the le@@ vi@@ al force of music took it back into a family of musi@@ cians who understood him , and he ach@@ ed him .
&quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way you &apos;re familiar with your fish , you get the fish that lo@@ ves more in love .
like the ph@@ ony block , the transi@@ st@@ or is much bigger , more complex cir@@ cles of building , a rock after another .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that deter@@ mine that you don &apos;t care about exi@@ sting their own hous@@ ing ow@@ ners .
so in these places , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that people have between two to 5@@ 9 different be@@ ds .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist because they &apos;re not playing with bo@@ unds , but with these little stran@@ ger particles .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , like a spr@@ ing@@ board of paper , and it &apos;s over the edge .
i went to a clean room with new si@@ li@@ ci@@ ties , and ra@@ ck@@ led for a hundred hours of all those great devices .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tom@@ b@@ ber , but i often see myself at the inter@@ section of the glamour and the li@@ f@@ way .
unfortunately , sometimes even kids who are trying to find their parents back in some cases for a decade .
i have friends , the big , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends who make little type of da@@ i movies like me .
what brings me to the second techni@@ que that helps you deal with the problem of making decisi@@ on-@@ making ? it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ te .
why are people doing average until 30 to 30 percent more if you use an ec@@ -@@ card or a credit card than you use money ?
if you think that the one on the left is s@@ wing and the display on the right side of ja@@ zz , you cla@@ p in your hands .
i think that if you trained your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepar@@ ing the whole company to get a profit .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in in in tr@@ c@@ ca , squ@@ at@@ t-@@ fe@@ eding mana@@ gers on youtube . i look at youtube &apos;s videos .
i am a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i &apos;m defen@@ se people with an unusual body , but i have to ad@@ mit it &apos;s nervous .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in the world as you think and doing in the world .
they really came up with this , because this leads to an ex@@ tent toler@@ ant society , where de@@ ath@@ le@@ ous violence is not obser@@ ving .
and the reason why you often have different forms of surgery is because you &apos;re thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by your social categ@@ ories , because you thre@@ ad our social categ@@ ories .
we &apos;ve got hard talks about what point a body to the people , so that he &apos;s a different right than the fe@@ tal life .
an entire re@@ pris@@ onal community made out of the ground that made it a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can participa@@ te in .
again , people in different colors look like the an@@ atom@@ ical identi@@ ties of an@@ atom@@ ical identi@@ ties , again , successful .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it became a circle -- and the epi@@ phan@@ u@@ ation of which i talked about .
it &apos;s not death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but an on@@ going of your path of life cycle .
can you ask me , please come together , and please come together with the guy that i know that you found it in between .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve been taking pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want them to go please , please . &quot;
if you think that on the left ja@@ zz , and the one on the right is s@@ wing , please cla@@ p .
so we wonder@@ ed that we would take this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this problem .
we all want to be aware of the stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , seemed so hard .
i came up with a teacher in tor@@ onto , as a woman in tor@@ onto .
there were fe@@ der@@ al from about 20 centi@@ meters , black mou@@ l@@ brothers , a sub@@ way of the bun@@ k .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , ar@@ bio@@ ts , water and energy issues -- we have already .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate of liter@@ acy has gone up 25 percent of the past 1@@ 30 years .
we &apos;re going to bring it to our students with special focus on how it can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
this childhood is coming back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flo@@ wer and mark it .
so i under@@ ac@@ ted the kid@@ let , and a hospital and res@@ cu@@ e and a hospital assi@@ stant , came home and brought them home .
we &apos;ve heard all about fe@@ es and n@@ yl@@ y , but how many people outside india are familiar with their in@@ indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the fish of these fe@@ der@@ al repor@@ ts were very accu@@ rate , and the fis@@ her@@ men lived well about it , and they found it in ghana .
groups like anony@@ mous are up over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the main players on the field of online attac@@ ks .
the most beautiful is how you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that surro@@ und you to understand and you don &apos;t care about them in school .
for me , time for me to think and talk about the poor , the fe@@ der@@ al , which is never going to be at ted .
it doesn &apos;t give you the most privi@@ lege of the largest , the most powerful or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
i colle@@ cted a little team of people to me , for the lab@@ els , &quot; not &quot; an im@@ per@@ si@@ stent challenge .
and i have a hundred micro@@ gra@@ m of a white pul@@ se that i &apos;m trying to keep in the air@@ por@@ ts of security staf@@ f .
and that &apos;s not the fe@@ atures of old media , and they har@@ dly har@@ dly be the media of the media , but they &apos;re going to be able to deter@@ mine the conversation of the future .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose whole life of both and freedom was held together .
so i talked about ju@@ g@@ ger@@ -@@ lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion and training , and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and dis@@ se@@ min@@ ation of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and dis@@ se@@ min@@ ated .
because this is completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey c@@ low was bald , and his argument took five million times .
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you &apos;re not going to go for forever .
and once again , a letter to me is down -- and the i@@ pad knew about gps where i live , which is really to me .
they started to repli@@ cate in speci@@ alists in the community , special structures which were responsible for learning , understand and res@@ sing information .
and it conne@@ cts us all together to something that is much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to continue evol@@ vable way than we &apos;ve been .
we &apos;re at one point to the anal@@ o@@ g , as a cell phone organisms have developed too long .
but it was still a we@@ d@@ ding against the other volunte@@ ers and trying to find out what our jobs would be .
up to the day of day , you &apos;re going to be gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , because the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary .
and , of course , what you &apos;re starting to do is go and look and say , okay , i &apos;m just going to go into the inner myself .
and if i tell someone , give me s@@ alt or p@@ ars , and then he &apos;s going to think of where it &apos;s in .
gen@@ gen@@ -@@ engine@@ ered , yeah , like this kind of a@@ er@@ ial pi@@ ck@@ le , which is something that goes out so far , two centi@@ meters or something .
and the commer@@ cial device costs about five tent@@ h thousand or so something , ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le bo@@ und around the fif@@ th .
and it &apos;s that i &apos;m looking at a city explor@@ ing by looking at what places are positive or negative .
and i got up on the top of the image in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion in the medical museum .
so you really have to look at things , if i want to make some user , or intui@@ tively , what does it mean in the core .
much more importantly : are they physi@@ ologi@@ cally , so you can use them like building blocks simply through the way their hands and access to reach .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can get very elegan@@ t for the past , and i &apos;m going to bridge this phenomenon .
that means that i can actually trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human model model on a software and make the software a lot of us@@ ern@@ -@@ friend@@ ly .
it &apos;s using anyone from us and east &apos;s an acade@@ mi@@ m , sel@@ ec@@ ted , in@@ formed , in@@ formed , in@@ form .
this is not necessarily necessary because each any any coffee has actually had the capacity to grow technology as most lab devices , which is really like that .
i mean , it &apos;s basically all the environmental debate , the world department , four@@ -@@ year astronom@@ y , in quality .
we knew about a mechan@@ ism of hom@@ olog@@ a re@@ combin@@ ation , which uses biology to re@@ pair the biology of dna , which can put up on dna .
this is a picture of real design software that we &apos;re working on , which is actually going to sit down and design new species on the computer .
my k@@ ills was down , and after i re@@ turned , i &apos;d like to say , &quot; i would like to have the way that the only one was . &quot;
add to the possibility of the people in the lives of the people &apos;s lives , the expec@@ tations of the people have a lot of things about how well this possibility will be .
we &apos;ve engine@@ ered the pieces that we could just recy@@ cle them with enzy@@ mes , and there &apos;s an enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair those re@@ pair , and put it together .
you read in the letters , ta@@ gs , ti@@ ps , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ ites itself .
that &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters in genetic code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that &apos;s ever been created by people .
as you can see , it gro@@ ws on the dar@@ k@@ blue , this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter ; and it s@@ hr@@ un@@ k in summer .
these are the kind of thoughts that you can get somebody in the morning at 9 in the morning , and that &apos;s not what i want to do .
and in these opportunities , the po@@ em was trans@@ formed and in@@ t@@ act at the paper -- but back@@ wards -- from the last word for the first .
they put them together , and they started sing : al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god .
i can now repli@@ cate now this mental trade model , sel@@ ec@@ ted , in@@ formed , trans@@ fer , trans@@ fer , trans@@ fer trans@@ action in an interaction system .
there was a time when i was a boy because you could have a boy , and you would have wanted to have the phone , as long as of ma bell .
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print , which is useful .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including all of the time , to spend more and better games .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ cra@@ cy players are 22 hours per week , as compared to a divi@@ ded job .
so , it goes , right here , where my meat begins , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a small one-@@ year-old .
why we &apos;re looking for the vac@@ ation that we &apos;re looking for is a problem that we &apos;re looking at with a choice between the two types of self .
i think the most interesting thing that we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ up is a number that we didn &apos;t care about .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion of hor@@ mon@@ es , our har@@ dest as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions on top of food , better fo@@ ods .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ?
one child who can be born in new del@@ hi in new del@@ hi is to expect so long to live as the rich@@ est man in the world in 100 years .
lou@@ dly speaking , after 18 years , the fam@@ ine was not better . so the king decided to put a last cu@@ be game .
and , of course , it broke to hear the heart that the cop@@ i@@ le students had been told , they just suff@@ i@@ cient .
and , as we speak about bacteria , they realize that each of us in our inte@@ st@@ ine is more bacteri@@ al than cells in the rest of the body ?
so after this incredibly slow conversation , you might say , &quot; do you still want to go into that ridi@@ cul@@ ous machine and the future ? &quot; &quot;
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ constru@@ cted , the rest of the body is extra@@ cted by the rest of the body .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always re@@ used , and every time it does it , it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the date .
this is the thought i would like to leave you with , and fail is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
and the question was simple , that was a couple of thou@@ sand@@ -@@ 0@@ 0@@ th , the first cont@@ acts with the island , but i just started .
he said , &quot; yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ e@@ hl , re@@ sts , dry and food . &quot;
each audi@@ o , any phr@@ ase will get a sense , because i feel myself , because it &apos;s a personal de@@ bt from my time .
so , the circle between my existence as a science fi@@ ction , then as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation in reality .
and the reason is , i &apos;m hel@@ p@@ ful digital tools and processes to help teams team , cars , video games and &quot; visual . &quot;
but at the first three fac@@ tors , we now have gone through 26 billion of tons , and that &apos;s simply not enough to go out of !
the hard one is building the first re@@ actor , another billion to find the regular symptom@@ s and the location of the fact of this .
bill , i think for almost all humans here , when i say , i really hope you &apos;re true . thank you very much .
so , for example , we had a designer with no good experience in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ ing@@ be@@ ds as material .
imagine the engine , the sound , sound , sound , sound , sound , sound , sound .
stu@@ x@@ net passed into a lab , which didn &apos;t mo@@ unt our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ffer it , but i didn &apos;t want to eat it .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , which is going to move to other people , completely syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zed .
so , both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go at at the top , how jer@@ d@@ on &apos;s new gre@@ e@@ ks .
i &apos;ve had the feeling , i was pus@@ hed under under@@ water and finally reach@@ ed somebody down and raised my head , so i could brea@@ the . &quot;
d pal@@ m sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact of my gar@@ der on the environment , and also on my bac@@ ks .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months were born , so she is born on jun@@ e in jun@@ e 19@@ 80 .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; &quot; me a list of all experts on cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plants from our future stem . &quot;
whenever i go to the path , and whenever i open the medical age , they &apos;re going to be able to see hu@@ o@@ dor@@ effectively .
that means that each at@@ om is at the same time in two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i have paper that i would be able to do everything i might be wearing , if i first went pal@@ m spr@@ ings and che@@ wers .
none of those extreme decisions , bel@@ on@@ ging to the decisions that someone &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ded by people who are re@@ com@@ men@@ ded by the future financial well-@@ being of well-@@ being .
the united states has an incredible opportunity to allow people to be that they are , without nee@@ ding them to change the state of the state .
and the reason is , if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re really happ@@ ier , working hard than when we rela@@ x , or nothing .
and according to the cape conser@@ va@@ us , they were able to survive this fam@@ ine using this fam@@ ine , in which they sat on a day , and they sat in the next few .
because we asked these people , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad the whole thing was , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
the dete@@ c@@ tors are getting started slowly in the united states , not question , but in the u.@@ k , she &apos;s already going to see them in other countries .
up to this day , all the world of war@@ cra@@ cy players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years to solve the virtual problems of a@@ cer@@ ation .
and while this gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve just heard this colle@@ ction of just how they used to be , only we &apos;ve ad@@ ded a little bit of things .
so the next got the most successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ cially be@@ having , which says , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
evolution is a continu@@ ing issue on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the perspective of an ar@@ gent@@ er to the subject .
while chimpanze@@ es of big fear , mo@@ unt regi@@ ons will lead the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ o society of leg@@ is@@ lation .
i want you to think about two pa@@ irs , the center of 197@@ 9 , which is exactly the same moment , every single one is a baby -- okay .
and what we found was that the more fe@@ der@@ ds were off@@ ered that , in fact , the participa@@ tion rate was lower .
and none of it has a really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property . it &apos;s just our faith in which we create a stron@@ ger effect .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he made the wo@@ und and made sure that i wouldn &apos;t sell .
you can see the goo@@ gl@@ y , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of the ch@@ ase , but the upp@@ er fla@@ ws and causes of the brea@@ thing .
one night i was at a long time , and i thought my goo@@ dness , if a ju@@ dge could turn us into something else , then it has to have magic forces .
in my arri@@ val , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ er@@ t@@ ary leaders , and police er@@ ror er@@ ror er@@ r@@ ors .
in the hand@@ le , the court was full of people who were an@@ gry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality , about ine@@ quality .
in south africa , people have understood that ras@@ cket ras@@ sing is not going to be over@@ coming without the will@@ ing@@ ness of truth and con@@ sent .
one of three male men in 18 and 30 is in a prison in the prison , and in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side of it , or with un@@ related pun@@ ish@@ ment .
and it shows you the other mistake , not just to test , but in a lo@@ vely , suppor@@ ting way that all of them benefit .
fis@@ her@@ -@@ fund@@ ing countries that started already $ 10,000 , the industrial fis@@ her@@ y of this very ug@@ ly ship is called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
the largest part of fish , the little dots there on the ru@@ b@@ ble , the coral re@@ e@@ f , were coral ri@@ ff@@ -@@ fish fish .
and to called the car@@ r and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks come to the city . we want to talk .
right ? a pair of an actual ingre@@ di@@ less sub@@ stance of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient in the patient .
but the system isn &apos;t just sha@@ ped through questions that have ras@@ unded ra@@ c@@ tu@@ ity , it &apos;s also caused by poverty .
now , if you have this kind of a look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how you did it .
you &apos;ve seen t@@ ours &apos;s little evolutionary example , where he has shown a little bit of evolution in the &quot; con@@ markets program , directly in front of your eyes .
and if you think that &apos;s mad , you know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version , which has been taken four million times .
because there could be so easily invol@@ vement to the collapse of the hori@@ zon , which is so easily means that you accept assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
there &apos;s currently a project in california , which has cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
but web videos allow us to be terri@@ bly known by all our creative activi@@ ties in a part of the world of the world .
we bring our kids closer to the natural world and to the f@@ ence of the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combin@@ ations of programs , which came up slightly closer to the pro@@ position than others .
in an interaction of the book , you get a search out , you have to go out and collect with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ d@@ ds of natural objects .
we &apos;re all moving to a world where the natural forces of technology come closer , and in the magic and technology .
this is a four@@ -@@ foot hu@@ b -- she is very , very ti@@ l@@ ter@@ ing . and i &apos;m going to ster@@ ili@@ ze it a little bit of little ster@@ ili@@ zing .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of the u.k. colum@@ bi@@ an , and believed that these fore@@ sts are there , that there are no di@@ ets .
and then there were these moments -- the part will never forget -- she said that there were moments in the way that there were e@@ ye@@ ger@@ y .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen yourself in your life , you &apos;ve seen one such performance .
but the shor@@ t@@ cut is a little bit strange in my life and my career , which has made me think of my relationship with this work .
don &apos;t have any fear that you have your whole life writing and never create a book that is interested in someone in the world ? never ?
i &apos;m going to say really , because we &apos;re now all kind of friends -- it &apos;s most likely to be my greatest success of me .
it may be like genom@@ ical ch@@ im@@ ie , but we can , by turning the software dna , things quite dra@@ matic .
you know , i &apos;ve already talked about some of the projects before , about the human genome and what that means , and the discovery of discovery of genes .
ol@@ ren ! all the time for you all , just to get the m@@ ere human love and your sense of feeling to be there .
let me clear you . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry jo@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
and , you know , there &apos;s also about , yeah , that &apos;s what we are , what are we going to do , what do we want to do ?
and it &apos;s only sel@@ ec@@ sele@@ ction . we can sel@@ ec@@ tively sel@@ ec@@ tively sele@@ ct food from the power of chemicals or the fuel manufacturing and so on .
and this is a ti@@ ming network of a lot of the time , yes , infrastructure tur@@ tles , that have become all over the world .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ ine radio &apos;s three million pounds of radiation .
as if you take a web for images , where you &apos;re going to put in and the text of the website a lot of information about what the image is .
and the reason for this is that freedom in yourself is good , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an un@@ reli@@ able requi@@ re@@ ment for human human .
well , this super@@ ficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we have in the mil@@ len@@ nia .
he &apos;s kind of ho@@ o@@ on on the sides of the color@@ ed meas@@ ures , and as it was completely fro@@ zen , it was a dog with them .
and this is something that comes through the complexity that people use , and they use it , and they use it for using the use of the use .
this is a question which is very moving on as a designer , but also in the area of govern@@ mental and all kinds of things in the region .
because the truth is , if you break the gold glass glass , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom ; you &apos;ve got paraly@@ sis .
in the other aspe@@ cts of life , which is a lot of meaning@@ ful than that , the same explosion of choice , the same explosion of choice .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means to do all the problems that i give you and not have good grade in my class .
and he takes two weeks off the thoughts follo@@ ws the possibility that he had the opportunity to have a great par@@ king space to have a great par@@ king space .
these are the people who car@@ ried at at least , which is , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ bi@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g website .
one day she came out of watching a cli@@ ff ma@@ o and for those kinds of ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ons , she had to go for seven years into a tough camp .
along with il@@ m , we created the guy from liquid metal , which was an impact on how this effect would be done .
and why ? because , because , because they understand and sec@@ ure self-@@ assem@@ bly patterns are the key to build more rob@@ ust structures .
the vege@@ table mass mass , the top lan@@ k@@ ton , that &apos;s what the fish fe@@ e@@ ded .
i &apos;m an un@@ fortun@@ e strong fan , so i click this over here wondering that i &apos;m listening to all the expen@@ d@@ ges in the room .
in a certain sum@@ mary , i can go into the subject of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all of them together .
it was as though he was under the impact of an invisible ar@@ z@@ i , a chemical response , whose cat@@ aly@@ zer was my game .
we &apos;ve got over tens of millions of cop@@ ing projects , too , to ger@@ man up tens of me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ bat@@ battery now .
che@@ ap@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ ho@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ vi@@ x , mass destruction of mass , the united states of pres@@ iden@@ al ele@@ ction in 2000 .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ sis of disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
all we eat , each ri@@ ce , every two pe@@ ter@@ ley , every p@@ ure co@@ il , was changed by people .
it was a beautiful fish , well-@@ he@@ ated , good con@@ tradi@@ ction , pay@@ lo@@ com@@ ed , a pol@@ lin@@ ation of the memor@@ ies .
and to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to put my wr@@ ist over here .
and yeah , i want to just give you a sense of what you &apos;re quie@@ tting a little bit about , and you have a vision .
even now , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you expect for dinner until you continue , until you get the toi@@ let .
these notes are about the same or not exactly how a verb@@ al system , as well as very appe@@ ar@@ ely enough , descri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing descri@@ ption , descri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing a landscape .
you had to learn from nature , so you can &apos;t talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it su@@ c@@ essi@@ ve and ra@@ il@@ way .
so you have to engage with what &apos;s called , which is , and not just changing it that it &apos;s going to be something , but it &apos;s better to get better .
most of the most amazing is that we actually care about something , which is actually self-@@ understanding , but not that way .
this means for a child who has spent it to achieve a lot of the time of his life , the reci@@ pe of stories of his life .
but something like the &apos; n sol@@ ase , which is sort of a hundred wat@@ ts out of the quad@@ ch roof , which was a to@@ y .
people who never have , have never been able to get immedi@@ ate with their own body , like it is to form a ton .
but don &apos;t think of the lying as you might have heard , when people say nobody has reach@@ ed a wall .
because while they &apos;re dealing with it , they realize that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no speak@@ ers , it &apos;s a very happy man to be happy .
like , like a na@@ ther@@ light , or why the do@@ ors are open to the el@@ ev@@ ator , or as a ipo@@ d on touch , it respon@@ ds to touch .
you can see everything with fe@@ der@@ i@@ ties , your friends , and so we start a conversation about what you feel , when you &apos;re looking at those ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
this is the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asking recently : &quot; did you do that to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum of the museum ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve spent 30 days , nothing for this -- -- you know , at the beginning , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
so the idea is to show that mar@@ ks are part of the life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
have you got a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; focus , &quot; because that has an object -- but you know how it &apos;s going to happen ?
and i called them up , and i put her knowing , to compare her exper@@ ti@@ se to how we were in the code and in the data .
i was the one every week at the virg@@ in@@ o@@ qua@@ a green green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
but you could go to a completely new place , which is a whole new block of new block , which would be done on the laws of building and not rel@@ ate to it .
i loved it to go to this business , but to a moment i asked myself , &quot; well , how does it say that you never buy something ?
from the people who are dying as six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass tag .
so in a power for example , if the big rec@@ n@@ ine tur@@ bine you have to open , you &apos;ve got to open it in a milli@@ seconds .
now it turns out that even when you &apos;re going to go out of yourself , if you &apos;re out of choice , you have nega@@ tional consequences , you have nega@@ tional consequences .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , which is something called o@@ vot@@ ian tissue of ho@@ sti@@ cal tissue .
it seems like our culture is a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic expec@@ tation : &quot; good , we need to move somewhere , so we put it somewhere . &quot;
what sud@@ pol@@ ar found is that we have found people from the members of our society , : : useful and an contribu@@ tion .
why don &apos;t have the news of the h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h machine ? &quot;
but because this individual &apos;s reci@@ ders are missing to recognize the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t respond to te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
we let them go into foot@@ sc@@ pl@@ ray lower lower , one of the work@@ ing-@@ class occu@@ pants , whose population of im@@ migr@@ ant la@@ yers is made of im@@ migr@@ ant la@@ yers .
so , again , we had to go into the park , so we felt as a part of the spra@@ y scene scene .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re because of the history that i told you about the and@@ ro@@ making reci@@ pes .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the olymp@@ ics 20@@ 20@@ 20@@ s , and it &apos;s as kind of the connection to the community .
it begins with the sex increase , and then the bush publi@@ sh@@ ing and in@@ last , people actually make art .
in the places that are almost 60 on@@ ds , the participa@@ tion announ@@ c@@ ements , in which i think , is about the six@@ th-@@ day percentage .
and of course it was a great , old syn@@ thesis ra@@ dic@@ ary dic@@ tion@@ ary . i just thought that the out@@ put must be very old .
and then this community formed of people who jo@@ ined this great insi@@ ght , and they started talking about it , and so on .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educ@@ ated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
so my em@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under water .
and i went through those tel@@ er@@ a@@ c , because she came up with the break@@ through on the inten@@ sity unit and i hop@@ ed that they would catch .
in fact , that mountain of dro@@ mm@@ ers will re@@ constru@@ ct each time , when they go into areas , where they go into areas where they &apos;ve never been fish .
you &apos;re going to con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence you &apos;re in a earlier form are not as much as you would like to describe the evidence .
and perhaps i &apos;ve been in the business for a long time than i can let it allow me to give a piece of my own fal@@ se pre@@ stige to do this .
and we have three billion new heads , where we &apos;re online to work online to get the new challenges , and to do what we need to do .
in the 198@@ 0s , in the 198@@ 0s , in the commun@@ ist germany , you had to be , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you have to regi@@ ster the government regi@@ ster@@ er in the government .
and i say that today it &apos;s more likely to be vic@@ tim of an online fra@@ gi@@ le than a for@@ gi@@ le in the real world .
instead of having to co@@ ok , you have to de@@ constru@@ ct , you know , de@@ lic@@ ate experiences of them with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
le@@ da@@ da@@ r -- like ted willi@@ ams lea@@ gue -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball players who met during a regular seas@@ on over 400 times .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
i think that we &apos;ve learned that words really have a teacher , but the words of a privi@@ l@@ ted teacher is especially meaning@@ ful .
and she said , &quot; next , i feel that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interest@@ ingly , it &apos;s going to happen when those tr@@ it recei@@ ves a trick about abstra@@ ction .
my current activity is to design objects such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
the issue of environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , their computers , without no way .
but they were not much alive today , because each one of them was only a small , random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
but then technology became the electro@@ ly@@ mp@@ s , and made al@@ umin@@ um production so cheap that we use it to our thro@@ wa@@ way ment@@ ality .
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural and i have a brother who passed a year older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
and most of all , i want to leave you with those of you who are looking at this , just lose the target of your eyes . don &apos;t give up the target .
it &apos;s the way that food , electrical engineering -- and communication cost cost to be a multi@@ mer@@ si@@ ble redu@@ ction .
but the truth is that we change ourselves , of course , whether whether you care physi@@ cally , whether you even care physi@@ cally , whether you even care physi@@ cally .
and from those 6@@ 6@@ ,000 languages today , as we sit here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , that half of them don &apos;t care about the e@@ ars of kids .
i could also take it , but in the united states nobody , no one ter@@ ved , in so far , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arian .
and where you can see , even in something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ king bio@@ -@@ terror@@ ism is not tren@@ ding that our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c products .
and as we see things , what we look at and how we diver@@ se it against the environment , so that we can actually diver@@ se it .
and , of course , the question is , what is the most intui@@ tive trade of the people and now i have gu@@ essed .
and this is on a higher gra@@ il of the user metaphor as the trans@@ mission of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
and then , you know , their brain is measu@@ red , and after what they thought they were , or how they thought they &apos;re different in the room .
they &apos;re a little bit more technologi@@ cal , and also a little bit of a busin@@ ess@@ -@@ consum@@ ing sub@@ way , because they &apos;re going to get asked , yeah , asking questions .
that means that the whole western civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ story is evol@@ ving by the fact that the city has always taken up , but never given a little back .
and it &apos;s not for the company , and it &apos;s not for the company pu@@ ma by trial , but for example , that they help this company to make good products .
we can do things now that , if you drop down , you can go down into biological cir@@ cles in biological cir@@ cles .
but definitely now it &apos;s not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame@@ work .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar that was named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ine , and after this is the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el .
and so i promis@@ ed what i was expe@@ cting , and what i had been de@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted compared to what i was expe@@ cting .
so , if people make decisions , and even when the results are good , they feel mis@@ er@@ able about it , they care about themselves .
not to give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the emplo@@ yer who would have been happy to be happy .
dan gil@@ bert did a great deal of doing this morning by saying how much the way we ev@@ al@@ u@@ late things , it depen@@ ds on how we ev@@ al@@ u@@ late things .
and the more opportunities to choice , the more attra@@ ctive properties of that choice will be taken into op@@ per@@ a .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , which is an electrical supply company on the island , has said , &quot; we find that great .
this is from the u.s. a network , which is actually a kind of a for@@ um , where you &apos;re hit and online .
and also , to write the genetic code has been very slow , but the last point is now going to go up to an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult to understand the fact that we pass over our bor@@ ders , educ@@ ates the value of things like l@@ h@@ c .
from soc@@ rates , he &apos;s known to believe he had a da@@ mon who he had a da@@ wn , which he had a da@@ wn .
in the descri@@ ption to my talk , i wrote myself as an interpre@@ tation , as a transl@@ ator , i understand it as a transl@@ ator , i understand .
they call the older brothers brothers and saying that we are the yo@@ unger brothers brothers , the destruction of the world .
so if you take another example , if you take a bag larger , you don &apos;t need any reason , and you don &apos;t care about anything .
there &apos;s a p@@ ill twice a day , not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t see myself at the accu@@ ra@@ cy of the present . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
we have trust in institutions , auth@@ ority , and sometimes in the science of science , there &apos;s no reason why that should not be .
if you &apos;re going to go on this path where belief and the magic , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
of course it &apos;s being stuck there , but through the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , by my finger , finger , that &apos;s now .
and i &apos;m asking myself , what would you choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot recently , and they all wanted to go to the past .
and we need to track this break@@ through , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to measure : in a corpo@@ rate way , in a corpo@@ rate way .
and i probably have a lot of my memor@@ ies on these three-@@ wee@@ ds , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
you know how satis@@ fied somebody with your life , and the teacher really doesn &apos;t care about how happy he lives his life and vice ver@@ sa .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we re@@ gar@@ ded ourselves ; we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed . we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , fru@@ strated , fru@@ strated or cy@@ cles .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce them , the billions of people who are fe@@ eding , without the land on which they live .
we trust that someone is taking us that the rules that are going to give us the same and end up ti@@ ll the game .
but if we lower the price -- let &apos;s cut up the price -- meet a new bar@@ rier , and that bar@@ rier depen@@ ds on co2 .
who can guar@@ an@@ tee a lot of billions of times bigger than any amount of waste you can imagine from nuclear nuclear and other ?
well , he goes on telling me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat , which they eat in the wil@@ der@@ ness .
it &apos;s pi@@ vo@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter after one day of death , say un@@ acci@@ dents .
you can see , you can brow@@ se in the net for the first time it actually is a grid , not just page page , but much more much more abstra@@ ct .
here was a company who was trying to solve what this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for our che@@ fs has become , how do we stop fish on our se@@ wers ?
so , to achieve this 80 percent , the industrial nations , including countries like china , their electric generation of everything .
this is the waste , which is 99 percent , and you have the part that &apos;s already bur@@ ned by it , which is called the u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous pri@@ ority .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
the rest of the 20 percent are going to be in poor countries , and it &apos;s still a little bit of an agri@@ cultural . hopefully , wal@@ -@@ thre@@ ats and c@@ ement goes to until then .
so to acceler@@ ate it , turn it down , turn it on this butt@@ on , and it &apos;s pul@@ ling the moment@@ arily faster or slow .
and then we were looking for the ti@@ vis@@ as and data and trying to bring these to the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
and we started our attention , and we started a lab project in which we infe@@ cted our environment , and studying this constru@@ ct .
later , i &apos;ve figured out that , about the same time , ja@@ zz and oc@@ tac@@ o talked about the challenge of a re@@ form in h@@ unter@@ as .
so when a single at@@ om can be at the same time at two different places , this piece can be in two different places , why not you ?
because if all of these things are made of particles and all these particles are the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , they shouldn &apos;t just do all the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
because she surro@@ unded the middle man , and they said that ag@@ gre@@ gation , perhaps not their interest in feeling in mind .
i needed somebody who could actually come in my head , somebody who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; brand character . &quot;
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely hard to say , some really known mar@@ ks .
what i want to do is make a film around the way that we have plac@@ ement plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the whole film is going to be made by products plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
we &apos;re going to give you a new lot of technology , but for the supp@@ lied , we need technology and laws and laws , and it &apos;s common@@ ly laws that with@@ held us .
so what is it for an idea to say that every family has an ele@@ ction between several cities , in compe@@ ting to new resi@@ dents ?
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we were eating them , and we gave them to their family eight because it was necessary for their family to get to their family because it was necessary .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher , woman po@@ sts , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard the higher business layer and a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can actually do it .
the last images that i would like to show you is an ice mountain that i &apos;ve made in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ see@@ a in green@@ land .
and since i don &apos;t bel@@ ong to me , as the woman here at ted , here at ted , i found a couple of things .
what i know is that it really matters to think about the idea that the united states is leading in leaders to make thoughts about questions of democracy .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because life &apos;s about the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s of more than the cam@@ a su@@ tra .
by impro@@ vement , au@@ ming , and through the study of consumer users , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city on them .
if i don &apos;t have the poverty fighting , i re@@ f@@ use as a fire@@ age of a fire@@ age of a fire@@ age of the fire .
it &apos;s all you can see in this picture , within four years , have grown after it , which is appro@@ ved by four , which is appro@@ ved to get appro@@ ved .
because at this point an individual -- learning this is happening within the time of a single organis@@ m , instead of having these evolutionary sp@@ an .
some of those oil oil recei@@ ves have a special combin@@ ation of chemicals , which allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals of the outside , and growing them grow .
and if everything happens , and i &apos;m very hop@@ e@@ ful , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a showed this technology global in 20@@ 6 countries all over the planet .
first of all , how often you care about , in good times , war or peace , re@@ ven@@ u@@ es , depression and high jun@@ k@@ ies .
i go to the study prison , and i go to a mand@@ ant who might be 13 or 14 years old , and the adult is supposed to be in adul@@ tho@@ od .
then , to me , woman car@@ r was introduced to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you need to be very , very ta@@ il@@ ing . &quot;
it was very quie@@ tly , and then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we never res@@ ist to the syste@@ matic fight of people .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to have eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up in the morning and walked into the living room . all my cou@@ sin went around .
i became big in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ -@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold who was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ in of domin@@ ance , and this matri@@ f was my grandmother .
adap@@ t@@ ant technologies have come up with me since , again , to clim@@ b , and even go with the hands of bi@@ ke .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve obser@@ ved three basic negative consequences of the consequences that offer more and more choices with them .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is 2.@@ 5 billion years , and the earth was a huge , ster@@ i@@ le stein@@ -@@ bri@@ t@@ ling .
we were later told that when it was about the normal chan@@ nel , it would have taken over two million dollars and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation , and somebody brea@@ ks together , it &apos;s your own relative to your own rela@@ tives or somebody else , you can find such an a@@ is@@ ed .
it &apos;s not very acade@@ mic -- she &apos;s a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a and ask patients , &quot; how do we do ? &quot;
it &apos;s important that one person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers is a stand@@ point of view , with a great audience and doing the process acceler@@ ated .
even though the ge@@ ars , i don &apos;t care about my pre@@ ference at the inter@@ ior of the inner .
as pro@@ ton and gam@@ ble , the different head and the back of the 2@@ 26 is re@@ duced by 26 percent .
when i found the main man , he had just been in a very serious conversation with ow@@ ners who had certainly had one of the worst days of their lives .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i get a lot of form@@ es , you &apos;re going to see ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
well , this is an amazing thing to think of as the mag@@ net wei@@ gh over 20 tons of s@@ essi@@ ons , and around 30 centi@@ meters .
i don &apos;t know if this was the greatest ju@@ ice , or this , when somebody went to visit the google , and the sho@@ ot@@ t-@@ page was like this .
but a li@@ pp@@ er , even at this light , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
and none of these facili@@ ties , we have built over hundreds of tw@@ ent@@ y now in the last 20 years , none of these facili@@ ties ever had ever been s@@ ab@@ red .
because in the rule , we have this new kind of ability , so the natural user is sensitive to , for example , the natural user .
because , if you were reading about it , from se@@ af@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it yourself , and you haven &apos;t seen it yourself .
the largest single factor for the global warming , bes@@ i@@ de , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fu@@ els .
after some time of refle@@ ctive , i think i &apos;ve got to continue to repli@@ cate , a kind of sh@@ ell of psych@@ ological con@@ struc@@ tions .
but to be fair -- the group of the chem@@ ist have no one of the cent@@ u@@ ries of al@@ co@@ hol man@@ -@@ depression .
but i was lucky enough to know him , very early , 3@@ 6 , and so i had already enter@@ ed my shoul@@ der on his cour@@ ses .
and again , you don &apos;t care about his teacher , that you like to put it somewhere , put it in place , and enjoy if the fire sp@@ ends high .
we &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to impro@@ ving people , and our target is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
they &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , and we &apos;re always a year back there , and there &apos;s a dollar too little , if it &apos;s about the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red .
my favorite one is in the middle -- there &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ -@@ play@@ ball@@ -@@ ha@@ un@@ -@@ ha@@ un@@ -@@ ha@@ un@@ -@@ ha@@ un@@ ge fac@@ es .
when people have freedom , each of us is to do things for ourselves to do the things that co@@ ordin@@ ate our common ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing and nobody has to decide for us .
you can see that if we create this kind of opini@@ on where we can pass through images , and that experience of several resol@@ ution .
we have designed a fal@@ se display with very high resol@@ ution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we &apos;ve ad@@ ded addi@@ tional content .
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a toi@@ let with open taste and a glass of water .
the eastern government gave up the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l 199@@ 9 , the most complete control of an area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music to have it over to another possibility , which is to sound over .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing to do -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is im@@ it@@ ated .
in fact , if you could lower the price of one thing , the poverty redu@@ ction would be energy at the most effective .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that doesn &apos;t simply lead , but lead to us as individual as individual .
if i look into the next decade , i &apos;m sure of two things : that we can create any imagination , and that we can play all kinds of games .
why ? this picture is pretty much exactly why i think that games is so vi@@ able for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
and if i close my hand , the same thing , by turning back , is hidden by this movement that the fing@@ ers re@@ moved .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time for you to go through anything . it &apos;s nothing in my sle@@ e@@ ve , or get there .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , somebody , maybe , somebody in la@@ gos , in a plane and fly , right now , he &apos;s talking about o@@ hi@@ o .
and of course there &apos;s also a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da , &quot; and under the best ones , they have fresh van@@ e@@ ars .
its completely non-@@ non-@@ non-@@ massive sensor@@ s in the cru@@ b , the signals send back to the on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d computer , which is here on her back .
and if you have those predic@@ tions in front of you , you understand the lo@@ gic , which we &apos;re going to be lucky with this happiness .
since , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours of under@@ water , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water . 500 hours of it in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ sis .
i said , &quot; mi@@ c@@ el , is a good d@@ hin@@ ted bird , not the last thing you want to hit on a fish . &quot; &quot;
steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n is the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
and i &apos;m just going to say that in the next 30 years , the same capacity of electro@@ chemical stor@@ age is going to be on the entire world .
so we &apos;re not a bat@@ ter@@ maker , but we &apos;re define as a company which is only between the subject of battery and the theme , and everything in between .
this will be an energy be@@ er , which is , you know , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , you will be familiar with it .
and yes , many of what &apos;s been described now , because a lot , many beautiful expres@@ sions of what i &apos;ve been travel@@ ing with .
yeah , they go to a cock@@ tail party and there you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about their own mistake .
and a kind of digital ligh@@ ting in the night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
mar@@ ia hin@@ ing can &apos;t percei@@ ve any the same in any states , which has the right to mar@@ ry in all states , that &apos;s the right to mar@@ ry .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hon@@ or@@ an of them if you wanted to build a new city , which is at least 1,000 square squ@@ ar@@ es .
in the next plan@@ tation elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo lo@@ bo in a de@@ va@@ st@@ ation , whose program was going to be in the re@@ co@@ very , as well as again .
but you know what you were going to do in this a@@ partment , and whose environment , whose environment , their lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion .
so i would be able to feel more comfortable with this whole thing , if we could somehow show that the da@@ y-@@ day things would be the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
in the course of the film we had more than 500 companies that were up and down , and the &quot; no &quot; said &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
but we &apos;re not only going to be just the mar@@ ke x as a ti@@ tle un@@ conscious , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we sell each possible categ@@ ory in the film .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them and ask them to cla@@ p , if they &apos;re willing to pick up g@@ ary &apos;s supply .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got , i am going to be a very public conf@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
if you use the standard sele@@ ction of choice , it means that you &apos;re going to be over@@ going , that &apos;s the ulti@@ mate , i lose them .
and if we &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a body that actually represents something very different , it &apos;s kind of conf@@ using in terms of those categ@@ ories .
and as a con@@ sequence became a male chan@@ cer , his brain was a typical male part of the hor@@ mon@@ mine spectrum .
he &apos;s got x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his side as so strong that they &apos;ve made a male hor@@ mon@@ ic .
it &apos;s a place where the women lead the reci@@ pes with sex , say , and the game follo@@ ws the day -- where fun is a serious business .
it was in the middle of the night and she was in the bat@@ h and bar@@ bar@@ h under the rain , while her house was born in fl@@ ames .
it won &apos;t be far away until the reality will be that there &apos;s a $ $ 00@@ 0-@@ human human genom@@ es , and it &apos;s getting more available for everybody .
this is a picture of a big , new city , which is called in southern korea , which is a lot of the time in the north centers .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the death of the body in evolution in the same moment occur@@ s at the same moment as sexual growth redu@@ ction .
back then , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ prin@@ ce had had ar@@ jun@@ a , he took a bo@@ w , sho@@ ot in the soil and water .
and the process fe@@ e@@ ds on itself and becomes so , i think , auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for -- if something changed its appe@@ ar@@ ance .
the first con@@ cre@@ te st@@ ones were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and made a simple idea : mo@@ le tur@@ k with c@@ ement , who actually fit together .
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate you need , if you have a website with h@@ et@@ ps , with ss@@ l-@@ -@@ en@@ cr@@ yed sti@@ cks , for example .
and then they stre@@ tch out their pu@@ p@@ ills , they turn off their head , and they s@@ wal@@ low off their stories , and they start to tell their stories .
we think because you taught us that the true question is : did a man deser@@ ve to die for a human being ?
she took me out and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to tell you that you don &apos;t pass it . &quot;
one or two hours later , if i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; well , do you feel my hu@@ ar@@ thing ? &quot;
there &apos;s the usual thing . it &apos;s not the usual , but it &apos;s not the normal , and you really want to know this guy , and you really want to know them ?
i sat in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 together with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , wh@@ ale one map , and he says , &quot; look . look at that .
what you find out is that the people who are running from the many to the ger@@ ms of the an@@ gles are always going to be the standard sele@@ ction .
we pass the same steps , which is several cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we put data on the data , pres@@ sing data .
this could be a hy@@ dr@@ hy@@ mer , un@@ cr@@ us@@ hed to h@@ unter@@ s , a che@@ aper to turn on a com@@ po@@ und .
now , for those of us who raised government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , about the world that we want to leave our children .
these could be cu@@ ri@@ er@@ al services , or tech techni@@ cians , just to make sure that the mel@@ ted a@@ ed was still in his place .
so the things that make a reali@@ stic look , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about in our everyday lives .
it also sets me excited about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to get care of interest with interest .
i think we would all know all the mo@@ od , the woo@@ dy allen , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to be able to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
now there are some of us who forget that , if i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of being my wish .
and this is , yes , this is quite young people , but the only thing that actually agre@@ es to , is this fascin@@ ation of technology .
the red light that conne@@ cts those connections is our depen@@ den@@ cy on carbon plants like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
imagine , for example , if you have your wife sa@@ d@@ ged , if you have them , and you get five ro@@ ses .
and by the way , if you want to do something , put yourself in germany , the best appropriate for all of us is in fr@@ as@@ h@@ ness .
and ha@@ cker spaces , which is the computer base spaces , because the c@@ -@@ base of the 25@@ th was the first ne@@ old hundred six@@ t@@ y-@@ eight .
and if you want to be an in@@ formed citi@@ zen@@ ship in society , and i want to talk to you , you need to have access to knowledge and technology .
and the machines that do this kind of thing , which are quite expensive , they get the che@@ ap@@ est way to go out with four@@ -@@ page .
and this is bio@@ fu@@ els that i mentioned , which is a little bit of a kind of k@@ ha@@ ck@@ space , which is that , kind of , a kind of a kind of a vol@@ k@@ sho@@ ck in the molecular biology .
and you know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty of this future , and the mirror is not lying , that can &apos;t lie out of this exten@@ sion .
you can move to hand , you can see each other , you can repli@@ cate , and you have a screen , and you have a screen , and you have a screen , and you have a screen , and you have a screen .
this indi@@ c@@ ates that the inside of the bu@@ b has already known that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t say &apos;t lou@@ dly .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double , if we pass this critical point .
so he begins to go up to this old re@@ co@@ very , like i &apos;m going to be going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tra@@ cked by this song forever .
but then he was getting older and quie@@ ter . he told me that he was going to go on a fa@@ ke in los angeles , and that changed everything for him .
for me , the best living example is , how do you can do this for the musi@@ cians tom . i got asked him a few years ago .
if we could print it with a si@@ zes of 10 and without any circum@@ stances , there would be 14@@ 2 pages , just to print those genetic code .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of this letter -- these letters sp@@ ines about 20 pounds of code , and here &apos;s a single contro@@ ls for each of those amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
if all the finger is in time , and right just as it does in the notes it &apos;s going to get rid of sound that sounds like music .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice in terms of decisions in terms of decisions , and again , whether we should be working or not working .
the data came from the united states from england , from the u.k. , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ related , no connection , no cor@@ related , no connection .
anyway , the part , which has to do with curi@@ osity and science , it was all about it . it was de@@ ad@@ ly , it was curi@@ osity .
you can make them stron@@ ger social bon@@ ds when in the real life , they get more re@@ vie@@ wers and re@@ wards in play as real life .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a fear of fear , but also the very first concent@@ r@@ ated , very difficult to fix the problems of doing a really difficult problem .
patient has a lot more tar@@ ge@@ ted . his inte@@ st@@ ine was longer longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
there &apos;s a living who lives in the present , and the present is capable of experi@@ en@@ cing the past , but it &apos;s just the present .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not as stupid , and pass yourself into the skin , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
and in a couple of hours , he goes and r@@ ent a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these fantastic ted@@ ets ton@@ ight ton@@ ight .
a man who has opened up tur@@ do@@ ors was my doctor &apos;s a@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in del@@ hi .
and i can say this from the reason that we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and i will never see again .
it &apos;s one of the pris@@ on@@ ers here from this great event , and i &apos;ve been asking myself whether i &apos;m going to give you a talk about wo@@ ol and my idea .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something ma@@ gi@@ cally , and the impact in the audience was the same . but we already played a little bit more money with the film .
so this is important because you only have to look at the web@@ sites in this sort of way , the whole internet , in the same way .
now , if i wanted to get a big picture , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it with the subject of bi@@ ke ? &quot;
and i realized that it wasn &apos;t just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia knowledge of music , but it would be a close personal relationship .
so over here we simu@@ late this entire trans@@ mission system , which is kilometers of physics in the c@@ ables , to form the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior in the net .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt of power and can get six hours for this performance and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of sort of simu@@ late .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started explor@@ ing the idea of explor@@ ing the power of the engineers in the hand of artificial artists and designers .
she lo@@ vel@@ li@@ zing the play@@ field and decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , the common confli@@ cts , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time thinking , because , if you imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
and he dre@@ w up for the first time in which his family and friends -- and you can imagine what a feeling that was on the par@@ king park .
some people like to give up and cl@@ am@@ ses to the bit@@ ter end , as others don &apos;t care about , and in a case dra@@ matic passion .
so many years ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
it was always pro@@ ved , and over this week , people coming to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great talks .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket has taken me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve put in this entire week .
he says we shouldn &apos;t ask people to do their own color paint , but after the property of their character , &quot; jud@@ gment . &quot;
of course , the problem is , and as we start to look at all the common@@ ali@@ ties , we have to start asking questions about why we think certain lin@@ ations .
and you don &apos;t need to -- as the attac@@ ks -- you don &apos;t have to get the data on a us@@ b key , how we have seen it at ma@@ x@@ net .
the green fa@@ thers came back and put it through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people were creating equal value .
and so we knew that , if we wanted to see that this piece of metal cros@@ sing quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to com@@ mit all the com@@ mit .
playing with creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the power of diversity of diversity , diversity of behaviors .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study with vac@@ cin@@ es against influ@@ enz@@ a in the cells of a tab@@ let .
the same technology that the human insu@@ lin can do in bacteria bacteria can make viruses that don &apos;t only have protection , but also to the imm@@ unity against other viruses .
now you can take a sequence of three billion base pa@@ irs of human genome to a price of 20@@ ,000 and in the room of about one week .
what if you could do the genetic change to elimin@@ ate or alzheimer &apos;s disease or the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es of cancer ?
i came up with recogni@@ tion as a doctor that i was working on a goal that was the end of the evolution of evolution -- not inevi@@ t@@ ably , just differently .
it &apos;s a really easy way for bacteria to be un@@ inten@@ ded under@@ pac@@ ks of un@@ inten@@ ded portra@@ its of un@@ inten@@ ded time .
so , really , my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
they were just told that the one-@@ day students and that are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they treated them .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i succe@@ e@@ ded , those are where i was acting with things that were directly inter@@ acting with things .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to their doctor and share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
i combin@@ ed it with my earlier pre@@ ference for my earlier pre@@ ference , but it was a little bit differently , because using the camera , the camera was actually the process of doing a lot in the planning .
and then on a des@@ cen@@ ded day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun , and i might be able to feel better again .
but remember that a ma@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or war@@ ri@@ er has a better mobile communication in the middle of ken@@ ia , 25 years ago .
and because of the fact that we don &apos;t care anything more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is in the tem@@ po@@ ral pac@@ ks that am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
i know , and i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re doing the job , because it comes out of a number of thousands of programs that have done this job .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to engage the function of the government in a way that can actually reach the society .
and you would have it with the state of govern@@ ance , if you could have had that , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and cheap alternative to state services .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up your do@@ ors in your house and see if the li@@ ve@@ li@@ a will go off ? &quot;
you have to separate two things : one to be the medical fact , am@@ pu@@ t@@ to and to the other , whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually catch , but i want to make it look like that as if you could have that , on a photo .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms coming out of the piece of metal are still there and at the same time , the same atoms go up and down .
in the other , i was in un@@ safe lives , the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , the drug ab@@ use of violence .
but unlike the ol@@ d-@@ class midd@@ le-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bia , their existence to me was completely un@@ familiar , there were no sophisti@@ cated thinking .
if you think of it in the spirit of the communication in sa@@ a@@ on , you have to be aware that his life has been a single waste .
in a world where every minute of video has u@@ plo@@ aded video , only unique and un@@ expected .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to provide all the people in this audience in this audience .
they had over 75 changes of o@@ live oil oil , including those who were in bo@@ xes who were in bo@@ xes , who were thousands of years old o@@ live trees .
when we were up , the light swi@@ t@@ ched , and the box would look , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
this is not the human@@ -@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein protein that is chemi@@ cally un@@ clear from what &apos;s coming out of the gut pan@@ us .
they have a strange language , and a l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ gen@@ ce is called the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ gen@@ ie : you have to mar@@ ry somebody who spea@@ ks another language .
the doctor &apos;s diagno@@ stic diagno@@ stic of my mother was in ur@@ n@@ ami , and so my parents knew the man who brought me in the world at all .
but perhaps it &apos;s not to be so full of p@@ ure if you didn &apos;t think of it from the beginning , that the most beautiful things of your existence come from you .
we have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed to 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , the shif@@ ting shift of the anal@@ o@@ g world of the digital world .
and , of course , we hope that we &apos;re going to be able to spread a similar spread and be similar , so that you can get more people involved in people .
because , like , at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a little bit of clu@@ e , and also no chance of making no chance of getting there .
so it &apos;s about getting genes to cop@@ e , that , d.@@ .@@ a , frag@@ ments , pe@@ sts , so that you can make them visible .
and most of these networks , the whole news has made up a scene that i &apos;d like to make for a long time , to te@@ ther portra@@ its .
and this is the software ha@@ ck@@ ers ha@@ cker , in the sie@@ ges , and the internet came out of ba@@ ths , and this is also the internet .
that &apos;s kind of the ha@@ cker scen@@ es , because this is not true what they actually did , what they actually started , and what actually happened behind .
so , as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is opening up new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces , which are better to ada@@ pt , as our brains and bodies work .
and this as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions that virtu@@ es the virtual reality of virtu@@ ing the people in the pre-@@ industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance , which i was talking about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that i was talking about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct of your work .
and that &apos;s actually what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the ability of our individual memor@@ ies on ex@@ ternal media .
so to buy new je@@ ans for a lot of years , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my body . &quot;
op@@ per@@ n@@ arian costs sen@@ ds the satis@@ fac@@ tion of happiness , which we get through our choice , including what we &apos;ve cho@@ sen to do is fantastic .
because it &apos;s 50 invest@@ ments that are out of choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to pick it up in tomorrow .
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly affec@@ ting your experience of the foot@@ ball of your child very differently .
and at the end , we &apos;re actually fac@@ ed by a choice in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ y or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of the diversity ?
he was in the age of two years in prison in the prison to hi@@ de under their rock@@ et@@ ton , because she couldn &apos;t live with it .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reality , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . for example , this plants here .
it &apos;s not as simple , but it &apos;s not impossible to do it , but it &apos;s not impossible for you to get enough curi@@ osity and enough energy , then you get far too far .
so to give a sense of sense , i needed to know something about this remarkable faith of the dou@@ ble@@ n and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o &apos;s not an cul@@ t of black magic .
and as you can see , this is a very in@@ r@@ enti@@ al area , and you had to actually navi@@ gate something from island to the island to raise food .
okay , so let &apos;s think about this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that meas@@ ures your success of their me@@ als .
terror@@ ism of terror@@ ism , but that was bald and sun@@ -@@ energy , and i started the middle of the time .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people more like , if we &apos;ve played them , even if they de@@ fe@@ ated them , even if they de@@ fe@@ ated them .
now , when we had started a couple of weeks ago , you &apos;d say that there was a really interesting result that came out of this gall@@ up of this gall@@ up .
and in this way , time is actually critical to the critical vari@@ able , which is a re@@ changing self from a living self . time very little impact on this story .
it &apos;s not ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time to understand what that means .
and you know what ? if i say , i look at people and saying , &quot; what does it care about ? let &apos;s do what you want to do .
we don &apos;t believe in a b@@ und@@ or of regi@@ mes of regi@@ ths that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
the idea of this company was to ski@@ p the phase of any prin@@ ting prin@@ ts with op@@ tical prin@@ ting etc , and also starting to start with digital products .
we have a com@@ ic com@@ ic about it , and we have a level of &quot; level , &quot; sustain@@ ability , vision , vision .
no , i &apos;ve actually got mi@@ ke of this fish , because , i swe@@ ar in god , the fish for the fish of chicken .
now you &apos;re going to wonder why , why are you going to catch up all the way up with so natural , arch@@ a@@ ic ur@@ forms of communication , inter@@ acting and so forth .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar that is called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he tells him sometimes , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ im , there &apos;s no will@@ ing@@ y freedom .
once you &apos;ve got to play a piece of ch@@ ase , because you &apos;re excited about studying research , you study it first for the design of the com@@ position of com@@ position .
so , it &apos;s not enough to learn , just read , and to put the case on the piano or the right one .
we want to be good for society , but if it &apos;s about the environment , but when it comes to environment , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate not to be there , right ?
that means that from local village actually has become a global village with the same principles , obviously , of course , obviously intui@@ tively , but the total total transpar@@ ency .
so , as i fl@@ our@@ ish , and when i s@@ mile , it &apos;s a very different co@@ verage of co@@ verage than if there &apos;s a living way of living .
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s what we &apos;re pres@@ ented now from the third group of social and social form .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill out the system with life , and when it &apos;s so , people also make mistake of time on time .
according to bur@@ den was the prime in janu@@ ary , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million re@@ vie@@ ws of this film .
well , there are mar@@ ks and ei@@ ght-@@ leg@@ ged mar@@ ks , those things that come and go , but a spo@@ ken , eight percent mar@@ ks is a pretty strong thing .
one country has already off@@ ered its upp@@ er fu@@ dge sh@@ ell , as dis@@ orders for the ent@@ r@@ ance dis@@ orders of the local court system .
in a country that &apos;s already a he@@ f@@ ful crisis behind it , it has been ele@@ cted in the con@@ gress for 1@@ 24 to a voice .
the director of con@@ gress came up with the stage , and i said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but could perhaps be the ted@@ talk .
i mean , it can make strange sound of thinking about two different places , but they were not born with this idea .
and this is not bad for a project at which , almost every ad agen@@ cy , who we were talking about , their custom@@ i@@ zed , re@@ com@@ men@@ ded of their custom@@ ers .
so i decided to go to visit the fi@@ li@@ der one day , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model that they give people all of them ? &quot;
i personally pre@@ fer@@ red that it &apos;s more easy to create a place where a place for discovery , because you don &apos;t have to com@@ promise com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
and then i say my friends , the little da@@ i movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these great , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies ? &quot;
i sent a pair of facebook news , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to give people the nam@@ f rights on my ted@@ talk .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , i met myself , related , turned into a box full of full and turned into my hands .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming work , nuclear par@@ ties and u@@ f@@ ted ni@@ ghts , dre@@ w tony to the first time .
many of our friends thought that we be beautiful enough to do that , and that we would go back and look at all the images in the walls .
when i gradu@@ ated at stanford at stanford , i went to this very ex@@ clu@@ sive life@@ -@@ life exchange ; at this time , he was really ex@@ clu@@ sive .
but they also store a secret for our future , a future where we have to ada@@ pt to more of the challenges , bigger creativity and prin@@ ting co@@ operation .
after all , this older black men came with a very sick fac@@ ial out@@ check in the court room , and put directly behind the defen@@ der bank .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to me and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died , you listen to listening . &quot;
well , in eg@@ y@@ pt , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in apri@@ l trans@@ fer@@ red the peak of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an police police , and what they found was a lot of stock .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst er@@ r@@ ors had happened in the first five years , what many of my colleagues would argue , but total non@@ sense .
imagine this device in the middle of the developing country where there doctors are no doctors , but 25 percent of the health care of health care .
remember , as a car@@ l sa@@ gan , the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger@@ -@@ space vehicle was coming back in 199@@ 0 , back to earth and turned back to earth ?
if i think about ab@@ und@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities .
we &apos;re going to have a process which requires 10@@ 0,000 years , and we can co@@ il it in thousands of years -- and perhaps even to the next hundred years .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in this : &quot; pre@@ formed in my tr@@ ash . can &apos;t say whether she &apos;s dead .
at nine people that we &apos;ve been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , one that we have made for inno@@ cent , who made it , and made out of death row .
i spend most of my time with the so@@ cially we@@ ak@@ est in the social sett@@ l@@ ings and in places that are very hop@@ e@@ ful .
there it is , this plane is hundreds of thousands of pieces of small@@ -@@ divi@@ ded parts , which are working together to make their flight more sec@@ ure ? &quot;
so , for example , an organis@@ m could not eat a particular fru@@ it because she didn &apos;t eat it , because she didn &apos;t care , the last time he she had e@@ aten .
but these app@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies that we don &apos;t only have consum@@ ers , and we don &apos;t only have consum@@ ers who are ta@@ xes , and they don &apos;t consu@@ me them .
what they come back was a an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they put it through another , radi@@ cally and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and the reason that i felt worse , i felt worse with all of these available ways , my expec@@ tations for what to do for a good pair of je@@ ans , all the way up .
that means that we first saw the first time before we see it in the back of the se@@ he@@ ge , to say , okay , okay .
and it &apos;s about how you &apos;re enter@@ ing people in inter@@ active media , so you can use this inter@@ active experience and create it .
and now you &apos;re just going to be able to do anything yourself , if you want to be interested in yourself , and most of all , if you &apos;re happy to be happy , that &apos;s the coura@@ ge .
but the lo@@ gic of the de@@ ception allows us to do so to do this as if the first sentence would be wrong .
i was at the time , when i put in one of his cour@@ ses , and i played the last of the four bal@@ la@@ in ch@@ op@@ in , one in the t@@ ours of ch@@ op@@ in .
it &apos;s always a very happy conc@@ ert , if i &apos;ve got to have the experience , which is that i &apos;ve been working so long in the future , how to experience it .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust if you see in it@@ al@@ y , like the people in the high bo@@ w co@@ w co@@ w out of the car .
and a lot of discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years with photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic .
but the measu@@ re@@ ment expres@@ sed very quickly , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to be able to do that .
one seas@@ on , if you do the full power of water , the enough pressure , i think so four@@ -@@ end to six times .
and what we did is we don &apos;t care , but that &apos;s what i think is , i think , has actually gone through a relatively good way to people who are there .
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t care everything for you . everybody knew you had this body repli@@ c@@ ator that helped you do it .
we &apos;re going to turn it down , and you expect to collect the first data in jun@@ e or j@@ ul@@ ly , and put out your journey to find out what the building blocks are .
his job is to create the conditions that were less than a billi@@ on-@@ th of a second after the universe of the universe -- and this continu@@ ing up to 600 million times within a second .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , because we don &apos;t care , or ga@@ thers , because that &apos;s not what we &apos;re talking about , or ga@@ thers , because that &apos;s not .
in fact , from a new point , we have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by putting up new lives .
and i was ama@@ zed at the resi@@ stance of what &apos;s the most effective measure in health care in human history .
but this is what kee@@ f@@ ites me at night -- one of the things that kee@@ ps me stopp@@ ing at night -- we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , still never .
and perhaps we can do it , wi@@ dri@@ tion@@ ary as a natural , con@@ co@@ ordin@@ ated and useful to see and feel so sick by their pres@@ ence .
but neu@@ lat@@ est dna evidence shows that the tr@@ m@@ man , which was later on the ro@@ man em@@ bo@@ s@@ ers , the same dna as the old sli@@ des .
so , as lucky as you can think of happiness , you can think about how you think and whether you think about it yourself , or whether you think about it yourself .
i say that i conver@@ ge my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
we need to have those entertain@@ ment , and we need to think , but if we get into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy that made .
it seems to be like we &apos;re right about the other parts of the building of life , but actually the most part , are the under@@ lying mechanis@@ ms our cells are pretty similar .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who were in@@ sur@@ cer@@ ated for years , and sometimes we were two to three months .
and sometimes it &apos;s a little bit of a prototyp@@ e of this experience , everything that takes us from a &quot; u@@ h &quot; moment . &quot;
there &apos;s a number of people who are much more &quot; u@@ h &quot; moments &quot; have gone to the other , and under the worst ones are fresh .
so this is what the re@@ ac@@ tors had a problem , which is what we put in , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do in our fill , which is dra@@ matically re@@ duced in the process .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a p@@ ill@@ ar -- you think you &apos;re going to bur@@ ke it without all the complex quali@@ ties .
so i stood up with a little team of un@@ known ter@@ rain , which is called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that wasn &apos;t there yet .
we want the world to create the inv@@ ent@@ or , because this world in which we live , because the world in which we live , these inter@@ active world , ours is ours .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with sexual people whose gender is at@@ yp@@ ti@@ an -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male male or female types of body types .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that let us do , and interact with the un@@ expected rela@@ tions that we form , are the ulti@@ mate water of creativity .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the drugs of stu@@ x@@ net are complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the data is a science of science .
my wife , and i moved to the garage , and the ha@@ ck@@ ers and the progra@@ mm@@ ers and the fa@@ sts of the house have taken our home .
and finally , satur@@ day : one , unique , personal , personal style is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one .
i love to find a different color@@ ful , crazy out@@ f@@ its of dete@@ cting , and in the last time too .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of the modern era , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he puts us in his &quot; i have a dream .
one of the areas in which we &apos;re seeing that , in our today , is the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
many journ@@ alists embra@@ ced me , &quot; what kind of things are you going to do , whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
and this is what i see as one of the people , along with most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , that need a good fra@@ ction of lo@@ gic to put the complex ideas together .
and it turns out that when you do it , it &apos;s a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people to preser@@ ve the ones that we love , but they pre@@ tend to be good at that .
and imagine , i even have a five-@@ year-old child in dr. p@@ . negoti@@ ated and so tries to stop those kinds of practic@@ es , which is natural without success .
so they found out , lou@@ dly speaking , the field and agre@@ ed , a national strategy , in a day , you would eat .
but also , because , because it turns out that by using this whole time , we actually change what we &apos;re able to do as humans in the circum@@ stances .
if you &apos;re playing games , you see some nu@@ an@@ ces here , looking up at the top and the mou@@ ths are a sign of optimis@@ m .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , &quot; climate . &quot;
if i tell you that somebody is being put their lives on a 10 , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with his living her@@ self .
are they reli@@ able , stable , family , in@@ born , sac@@ red , sac@@ red , in@@ cor@@ rec@@ tly , and the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
they didn &apos;t care because he was a remin@@ der ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all he had to keep himself .
i came to ted because i think a lot of you have understood that the moral pen@@ del of the universe is exten@@ ded , but that it creates justice .
it turns out to be in a world where the ger@@ man state of people would set up , especially when there &apos;s a lot of je@@ ws .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking his responsibility , that i was so hand@@ -@@ able to deal with my patients without having to touch it .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medical trans@@ fer@@ red , in which i feel a lot of well-@@ being or maybe a little less comfortable with them .
ladies and gentle@@ men , which is an enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us the great challenges of our planet .
how about the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever they are , a voice to give awareness and create change for the first time ?
and each year we asked the students , companies and services , and services , that can be de@@ va@@ stat@@ ed in a decade .
in the last hundred years , the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has increas@@ ed more than dou@@ bling , the average income income of the world &apos;s population has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
so this is just a bunch of cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days . or the last six years .
well , what i &apos;m tren@@ ding on is too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ lar@@ e , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to do huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
unlike the same conversation of the 20th century , the part of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by using it or something new .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of the other .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and they started communic@@ ating these cells , so communities evolved to cells .
and because of the government of us , their power -- remember , &quot; that &apos;s the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , affect the people , like this change happen .
so an ap@@ p is written in a few days , and then it spread from sel@@ ec@@ ted , is a kind of a shot in front of the bu@@ g of government .
but it could also be used to get people from their cha@@ irs , and bringing them to a kind of game to control their health .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try and find them , the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
i got a ti@@ cket , because i didn &apos;t stop on the bi@@ ke , but often there &apos;s dis@@ orders that don &apos;t continue on the bi@@ cycle .
what that means is , if you meet somebody and you would tell you , oh , his dad is a two-@@ page man , how much you would be aware of your hei@@ ght ?
this is ger@@ a@@ hu@@ an , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active pre@@ c@@ ision of the sha@@ man .
basically , you have any of the sp@@ ines on every si@@ ft@@ able basis of de@@ lic@@ ining letters , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you know , a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
i promis@@ ed lou@@ dly : : you know , you know , you know , and you know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my gu@@ il@@ t , right ?
from the ger@@ man into english , there can be more knowledge , because when you think about it , you can see that if you care about it , or care about poetry , or care about poetry .
and if we succe@@ ed , of course it works for us to be ob@@ ese , for ni@@ nie@@ es and ti@@ ri@@ tz , and all the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry with .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that , if you do something , you have to do something about classi@@ cal mer@@ re@@ l , five hours of the natural software and you only have one hour .
it &apos;s intui@@ tive that we don &apos;t only have a fundamental economic factor , which is a fundamental economic factor , which is element@@ ary econom@@ ies , if i put technologi@@ cal devices to people .
as you know , in the village at which , who knew what and when , what happens today is this exten@@ sion of our self-@@ assem@@ bly , on a global scale .
and there &apos;s a lot of times that we &apos;re giving to the media cam@@ pus for example of the virtual reality in our 7@@ ,@@ r@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ q . we can actually do this all the time .
i think that the molecular biology in general now generally , is , in general , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count , syn@@ thetic bi@@ ologists and so forth .
i can tell you the sound sound that the stream has had to sound on the modern wing , which is a b@@ aro@@ y c@@ em@@ b@@ o .
at this point , if you lau@@ gh , you know how important that lie is , and how much time it you need to get to experience something artists .
i am a mou@@ l@@ ler . i &apos;m going to work to the same time , and i have to go to the same time , and s@@ co@@ op , and really un@@ pleas@@ ant .
a process that -- how everyone knows , who has ever tried to do something to do -- in other words -- not always reas@@ on@@ able .
because it &apos;s as much sense of everything that i &apos;ve heard about , if it &apos;s about , the absolutely nu@@ in@@ e@@ ful cap@@ e@@ y@@ ard of the creative process .
so now it &apos;s too far , and for those of those who weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the greatest scientific experiment ever since -- 27 miles in diam@@ e@@ ter .
we have now , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies across the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we might be able to be a new form of the cam@@ brian explosion in which there could be massive new species of drugs on this digital design .
in each step we &apos;ve made these pieces in the artic@@ u@@ le that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
that means that the interpre@@ t of the emergen@@ ce is the emergen@@ ce of the emergen@@ ce language in another , which is adults , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al music language language .
and the reason is , it used to be better than anything worse than it was worse than it was bad for people to make an experience for people who were a pleas@@ ur@@ able surprise .
we can take a step further out and see the data , and see that cir@@ cular disease and cancer cancer is the usual sus@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , but not for anyone .
they star@@ er out at the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is ge@@ es@@ tor@@ e can@@ um@@ es , and those den@@ sity .
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ ali@@ able things , which are very cheap things , which are very cheap , we &apos;ve spent 20 years for inv@@ enting and 20 years .
the other grade is , if we use the zero emissions , whether you use the zer@@ o-@@ dollar emissions , whether you &apos;re using it in all parts of the world , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
and i started this &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship , &quot; it &apos;s been sold by a ship , a passionate film .
and something interesting happened . what happened to me about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows the idea of an un@@ known world on earth itself .
we all had to do that at the time . if we had children a book las@@ s , we took the descri@@ ption of the o@@ man and pro@@ proje@@ cted it on the can@@ v@@ as .
and since there &apos;s no video games that would have auto@@ ma@@ ted with computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated docum@@ ents all the way in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our hous@@ ing shows that we have , with his intri@@ gu@@ ing shows that we have never imag@@ ined .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year spend more than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
i &apos;ve said my wife , always when a human being used in a moral age , the words of choice , should try and replace it through the dic@@ tion@@ sy .
well , i was holding people with a pair of people in the company , no one could give me an awful answer until i finally had finally reach@@ ed the bi@@ ologists .
nin@@ et@@ percent percent of the big fish that we love to love the tun@@ a , the heal@@ ing bu@@ gs , they &apos;re broken .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later i got an email , that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in my own education class .
so we &apos;ve always tried to have this insu@@ l@@ er , which is an insu@@ l@@ t@@ ant , which has a very small net , which has got to do with our verb@@ al and nothing .
and , in fact , the european connection is basically a lot of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the wave goes all over europe .
and so we decided to put in ber@@ lin , in which we sort of put the electrical propor@@ tions in the scale of the scale .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re starting to be in charge of the dan@@ cing , the other one .
and i hand@@ led to myself that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to the perfe@@ ction , never again have a mistake that the voice could be cr@@ as@@ hed .
well , i hope that you agre@@ ed to me that number human resources are human resources that can use to work in the real life , and that games in change .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the head of the old gre@@ ek histor@@ ic , you might know this story . story about how and why games were invented .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable number of years , the last decades , that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted from a physics to a digital world .
so gender is really very complicated ; the sexual &apos;s not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distribu@@ ted over all the band@@ wid@@ th .
a few weeks later , a letter of the home@@ ow@@ ners had a letter of home@@ work in which they care about the band@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ ing process of their house .
and so far as the isol@@ ation moves , when we elimin@@ ated as a species , it becomes insu@@ lation and the changes of the environment , the evolution of natural in the natural way .
and by the way , we go and de@@ fe@@ ated and mix@@ ing , so much that you can &apos;t tell them that isol@@ ation is necessary for evolution to come up with .
and if you engineer the speed of this ro@@ tors , you &apos;re actually able to get the ro@@ tor , and eventually , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept of adverti@@ sing was so many people as possible to present their product as many people as possible .
when people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to put it on your head , everything that we believe , for example , in terms of ta@@ x politics and so forth .
these are two very different at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , the living self and the re@@ changing self , and the two will be part of the other terms of happiness .
it &apos;s the living self , which is a doctor -- you know , when doctor says , &quot; well , it hur@@ ts , when i put them here ? &quot;
the second tra@@ p is a sin@@ k of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s happy to be happy in his life and happy with his life .
but i think , in this picture here , with a de@@ ception of something real , i &apos;m going to just leave the need@@ le in there and go to the stage .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;re progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the beach in ven@@ ice , my kids and we made this one .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to experiment , see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s going to change it if it doesn &apos;t work , the most great achie@@ v@@ ements of humanity .
now , i &apos;m going to gui@@ de all of those pres@@ ents a lot of ti@@ me@@ -@@ in@@ struc@@ tions , gui@@ de all the programs , and choose for them to be the next . &quot;
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not that hard things to do things , you &apos;ve only got to build the proper@@ ly systems .
and i sent them home , mis@@ led a quie@@ t voice in me , trying to say , &quot; gold@@ man , no good idea . do not . &quot;
what do you think the average achie@@ vement for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ o@@ tis is supposed to be a res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant ?
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ ar@@ - or dna virus , which is not known , it &apos;s the health care , and pre@@ vent@@ ited a pan@@ de@@ mic in front of your turn .
we pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly suggest that in 10 years the rate of the civil rights of the civil rights is so high .
of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly in@@ struc@@ tions is in@@ struc@@ tions a very small way that you &apos;re in@@ struc@@ tional the numbers of numbers , so you don &apos;t care about the in@@ struc@@ tions , so you won &apos;t actually do the in@@ struc@@ tions of this .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing about honor is that you know each other because you &apos;ve been doing a job that you can explain to each other because you &apos;ve made a task that you can explain to you .
so when i started speaking with companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
my first memor@@ ies of this boat -- the ste@@ aling tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the cla@@ pping of each wave on the bu@@ g , the expan@@ der of any wave on the bu@@ g , the expan@@ der and empty hori@@ zon .
now , if you math it , people would get six times more like a glass stam@@ p , who you were six to pick out , when you had 24 degrees of sele@@ ction .
and these scientists just docum@@ ented the different subje@@ cts with these ce@@ o bus@@ es , and how much time they spent these decisions with them .
i recently made a po@@ ll about 2@@ 5,000 american americans , and the average number of choices , the ang@@ im@@ ed americans of a day , is 70 .
but it was quite an abstra@@ ct discussion in a place when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , could we possibly look at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul runs around and talking vac@@ cin@@ es and says , how valuable you are , and that people would stop to stop .
this is a people who doesn &apos;t exist between the colors of blue blue and blue , because the hea@@ ven scene shows up the forest , which people dep@@ end on .
you should have this innovation meeting , and you would be sho@@ ot@@ ed by the ridi@@ cul@@ ess , which is made for this innovative way .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the major reasons for global warming , the remarkable co@@ h@@ le@@ ar technology that you &apos;re seeing here , everything changes .
we &apos;re going to look at whether we can use carbon , which could just de@@ fy the co2 , conver@@ ts the co2 into the fuel to drive this process .
and because they &apos;re physi@@ cally working as we do , because they &apos;re only three to six months , they live in their weight of the energy consumption .
we &apos;ve only managed to have two years of phosp@@ hor@@ us and already through the phosp@@ hor@@ -@@ min@@ ing world , much more ur@@ ani@@ zed in the environment than all the an@@ nu@@ al facili@@ ties .
so , instead of having us to remember , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , common@@ ly common , in crow@@ ds of memor@@ ies that we can rel@@ ate to our personal memor@@ ies .
and then we have a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d burning , and the burning of the las@@ er sp@@ ends the las@@ er , and then she tries to focus on this camera .
they also go into this kind of arti@@ stic sense of biological materials , and , yes , also electr@@ on@@ g@@ bing , and combin@@ es it in some way .
food , which has been a che@@ f or a che@@ f , it has to be e@@ aten , and not just looked at it or re@@ cep@@ tives .
it depen@@ ds on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , and the one that does as though the opposite of the first sentence is already already pro@@ ven and pres@@ sur@@ ed .
and after a very short time , all of the characteri@@ stic of species were lost and conver@@ ted completely into a new species that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
it &apos;s been pri@@ red in the cell and recogni@@ ze the other chromo@@ some as alien to stran@@ ger and so on , and so we had only a cell with a new chromo@@ her@@ m .
and the sum of the se@@ man@@ tic cros@@ sing , and the thing that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
we see lots , many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photographs here who come up and come up and give up on any way .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious to those of us who have travel@@ ed to these dist@@ ant goals , reali@@ zing that they &apos;re at all .
and i &apos;m going to have more life@@ -@@ life trade than now and i &apos;m going to have to have a lot more of the music in the music of the music than we have today .
and this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , have 17 vari@@ ations in the a@@ hu@@ hu@@ ca , which you &apos;re all aware of in the forest that appear as a form .
now , if we go to the age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see that acci@@ dents are even the leading cause of the people to worry about .
we should call them , what she is , a well-@@ per@@ si@@ an , a well-@@ per@@ cu@@ ged way that &apos;s really allowed to en@@ able that production .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director must be also going to be able to be a leader like a shi@@ ff@@ on or something .
you &apos;re going to get into this cap@@ tain , and you ho@@ ok in this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment , where you don &apos;t care of yourself .
but in the middle of the 9@@ 0s , we realized that in the cre@@ at@@ u@@ i and a si@@ cker design , what we actually started to do -- too slow .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , as rich as what we really can tell us .
and my love to science fi@@ ction appe@@ ared in my environment , because back in the late 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ eing to moon and investi@@ ga@@ ted the deep sea .
everybody thinks i &apos;d run between ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; in the beach somewhere .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t care of any of the will@@ ing@@ ness of freedom , not for his acts and pres@@ cri@@ ption , and it &apos;s un@@ comfortable .
a drop in the sea , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love narra@@ tives , as roman@@ tically , is also true .
many argu@@ ments against it , fishing pollution pollution , the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , so we think of th@@ un@@ fish .
so , you know , there &apos;s a change that there is a change there , and it &apos;s only from this ab@@ sen@@ ce of time to the idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
that the system also has a pri@@ ority higher , because that we have tw@@ ent@@ y pri@@ ces on the other stuff , not pass .
and if you want to go through tw@@ ent@@ y , 30 percent of rene@@ w@@ able energy , so energy per year , you have to turn it off .
so if you take this system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the mis@@ er@@ able health in@@ sur@@ ers , at the end , there &apos;s no one left .
and that was , for us , very interesting , because architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , think about how people use things that we design .
not much a building that has open to open it , but a building that still brea@@ ks and holes in the water , you had to jump out .
and if you &apos;re playing with partic@@ le things , all kinds of weird things -- how they can fly straight through the walls , or they can be at the same time at the same time .
i think , &quot; no , &quot; is a great word that these categ@@ ory is really em@@ bo@@ died to something much more positive , unlike &quot; no fighting , &quot; and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ness . &quot;
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
my call to everybody today is : imagine , the same thing happens : imagine , the same thing happens in your flight -- please ask , and how would you change it ?
l@@ oud strong , and then , in dec@@ ember , we &apos;ve hon@@ or@@ ed the ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se magazine , which was really really nice .
but tomorrow , to put us the coming challenges -- think of the climate or the co2 emissions -- how can we then change from the digital world .
and so i had to develop these new intui@@ tions that this looks like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator in reality , which are really cros@@ sed objects in a small room .
in fact , that is obje@@ ctive , when the first time , when the second time , but i would make it lau@@ gh at the second time .
while i do this , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i &apos;ve learned to believe or not , for those ad@@ ne@@ c@@ tors , nothing new .
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars ser@@ ves for a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s a very unique way to buy .
if you look at the history of the green fa@@ thers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and you were interested in a natural world .
they were the idea that people who had political power , they should have political power because of the de@@ va@@ st@@ ated blood line of grand@@ father and so on .
and they make a pair of tests , and they find out that instead of ca@@ sti@@ le , in reality , in reality , and that they have a y chromo@@ some .
but it takes most to the pu@@ ber@@ ty and the brea@@ sts grow up and develop their brea@@ sts , but it &apos;s not reach@@ ing their peri@@ o@@ de until someone comes out there , that something else is .
the com@@ mit driver is not only people , but the light that seems to them and the wind , which seems to them , and the heat of the room .
well , in our cities , in the volun@@ t@@ ary , a high-@@ artic@@ ul@@ ated career fi@@ le has been suppor@@ ting a very early li@@ ft of a fire@@ age .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally defin@@ ing who you are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange one of the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ let , which had one for the growth of the growth of opti@@ m@@ y-@@ eight , they had more than others and more and more chemicals and divi@@ ded quickly .
and this has never been in the history of technology , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ si@@ ven@@ ess growth , which has exponenti@@ ally increas@@ ed exponenti@@ al growth every few years .
and i went through the same tor@@ ture of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , feeling stru@@ ck and covered in the work until it came back and forth again .
suppose you have a blind mind , and you will pass into an oper@@ ation of an oper@@ a@@ tional , that your average performance is in the blin@@ d@@ set of blin@@ d@@ ness .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the princi@@ pl@@ ing foundation that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million of the x of the x . &quot;
now , with all the digital devices that had seven days a week , all the negative news is all about all of these negative news , it &apos;s not mira@@ cles that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be the truth of truth and s@@ son .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought it back to the forest .
and most of all , we &apos;re ever going to be able to be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom of wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make to make these decisions choices ?
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was going through , reach@@ ing us , we pass it .
the interesting thing here is that this slide is like some other , which we often care about in our field , a kind of a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ged cur@@ ve .
it &apos;s not just code for america &apos;s &quot; fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country who come up and write govern@@ mental app@@ s everyday in their own communities .
and we think , well , we think this is one of the major problems why everybody -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects made mistakes : because we &apos;ve stopped listening .
i &apos;m now im@@ men@@ sely moved from my comfort to know that , yes , the world reve@@ ars , but not how you care about it .
and the women came up with their stories about men who don &apos;t des@@ per@@ ate change , an@@ gry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , of kids , cap@@ tured between two worl@@ ds .
and there were the sel@@ fish but pain@@ ful ch@@ ie@@ ons of the &quot; bad eye &quot; and here , &quot; people , go home . &quot;
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , you think , in a case , the sper@@ m is a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ und , which hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ gs .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the kog@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in north colum@@ bia , the extraordinary thing .
the second piece is that since this arch@@ a@@ ic models are able to be able to speak very , very quickly , even though we use a co@@ di@@ fied language .
it could give a property , wonderful , bizar@@ re , bizar@@ re , kind of a conversation between tom and the stran@@ ger , expres@@ sive thing , which didn &apos;t quite care about tom .
i ner@@ ve my dad until he finally had a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , out of the other side of the bor@@ der , where we lived .
she came from a man , a afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pathy , ra@@ y@@ less@@ ly , who was in a san@@ e way , which had two more sa@@ pe@@ ites .
there was so much that there was self-@@ admini@@ stra@@ ded drugs , and one of them was sitting in cros@@ sing h@@ unt , where you sus@@ pe@@ cted evil .
and it &apos;s taken me to ber@@ lin for years , because i wanted to do rene@@ w@@ able energy , and that &apos;s not what we wanted to do in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ h .
right now , we &apos;re building cor@@ n , and you &apos;re going to be able to do 30 pounds of 30 pounds per he@@ ct@@ are , or at the squ@@ ar@@ es .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more , but your emplo@@ yers , or someone dro@@ ps you , you know , how you care about those four hours of time .
because , you know , i could introdu@@ ce a cre@@ ase for which we could do a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window of the window .
and we start by taking the waste , which exists in these re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or dry bu@@ gs in the re@@ actor , that &apos;s our starting fuel .
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ al di@@ version of di@@ ving , which was a dist@@ ant , un@@ known , un@@ comfortable for people to come out of un@@ expla@@ ined , un@@ expla@@ ined , un@@ expla@@ ined .
all you need to do is look at the bit@@ ter dea@@ ths of the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century of the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century .
and what &apos;s going on with the creative corpo@@ ra@@ tions that they make us sec@@ ure about each other &apos;s mind -- in a way that others don &apos;t do it ?
we have fu@@ els of the second and third generation , which will be relatively short out of much higher performance , what oc@@ tan@@ e or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ o@@ ol .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption medicine for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , at no sense , because you don &apos;t buy any sense , because you don &apos;t buy it .
and this is the for@@ mal do@@ g@@ ma , which is , if our goal of ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the general well-@@ being of our citizens , this is all about ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing freedom of the individual .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , out of the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction : &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; hu@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the con@@ gr@@ ess@@ ing library and it &apos;s 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ ri@@ es .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3@@ .@@ 5 foot tru@@ ck , which has to be under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can kind of put across .
for remin@@ der yourself , it &apos;s har@@ dly much better than the wine vac@@ a@@ p , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies of that .
this app@@ lies to lau@@ gh , and it &apos;s for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that that &apos;s exactly how everyone else .
and the second is , as a spe@@ ery we have our environment so con@@ fir@@ ri@@ ts that we have made that they have made that they ada@@ pt to us , that they ada@@ pt to us , just as we ada@@ pt to them .
not just in darwin &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of people to survive and to fl@@ our@@ ish , of struggle to change through confli@@ cts .
i would say this : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the smar@@ test of his kind , but the one who could be the best ada@@ ge .
ur@@ ge@@ ty optimis@@ m is the desire to do something , a bar@@ rier to s@@ mile , to believe that we have a fo@@ unded hope of success .
it &apos;s going to take you for a while , and people will argue whether you want to study an experience happiness or whether you want to study life@@ -@@ grade , so we &apos;ve got to do this discussion quite soon .
well , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t think of happiness in the same way that we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you don &apos;t just think , if it &apos;s not only possible for your child &apos;s disease , but also the other genetic adap@@ tations , the disease and pre@@ fer would be .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , today , there are now do@@ zens of companies , and we need hundreds , the ones , the same , as well as their approach@@ es work , which works for their pil@@ ots .
i have some people left the number of books that are published in &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they had a lot more .
so , the fact that the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t care as well as the blue p@@ ill , which doesn &apos;t work as well as the p@@ ill@@ ars , which doesn &apos;t work as well as the need@@ le .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to go so far , we have a little bit gu@@ il@@ ty about what we think we don &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty , high tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
about 12 years ago , a story came published , a terrible story that the autis@@ m epide@@ mi@@ ble epide@@ mi@@ cs , mu@@ ff@@ s , and tu@@ ping v@@ acc@@ ine in connec@@ tivity .
drin@@ king water , the rain of oil , oil , oil , gas : they disappe@@ ar , and if we don &apos;t care of this chaos inno@@ vi@@ tion , we also go .
it dem@@ ands that we have all the senses on the task , and that we use our instin@@ ct as well as our emotions , and what we &apos;re doing in the challenge .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that was held by us from a world of sta@@ tic , inter@@ sta@@ cted bri@@ st@@ les to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
and only when he was 19 , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was intern@@ ally pain@@ ted that the doctors found out he was female .
game is a for@@ mal repli@@ c@@ ator , and it can be many forms of forms , some of which are quie@@ ted to discover phan@@ tom , ridi@@ cul@@ ous -- maybe to discover the most amazing again .
i have a company , the design and anima@@ tions , gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re in the art world and pay attention .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud from carto@@ ons to them and pass through them that they can look at , and they can look at it from many , many direc@@ tions .
and a part of me wonder , what if the content of a personal character would be something that would be visible in the future -- using f@@ mr@@ i visible ?
now , if you can now , the systems com@@ promis@@ ed , which revol@@ ts and venti@@ l@@ ings , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
and the us@@ ence of data comes into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ged the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear energy program .
and the reason for that is that it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s the first time that we have a lot of the genes that would have cho@@ sen to get a lot of genes out there .
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , ser@@ en@@ di@@ ty produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability , en@@ ding social nets to har@@ ish .
i know you &apos;re going to ask you , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that question i &apos;ve de@@ dic@@ ated my job over the last few years .
first , we have the in@@ sur@@ ance to@@ bac@@ ations , and indeed , there &apos;s a temp@@ le to get a ste@@ phen of haw@@ king , which he can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i studied in my ph@@ .@@ d. , why we &apos;re doing better than the real life .
you see , who we were and how life has been sha@@ ped us , we can see that the men , perhaps in our lives , would have reach@@ ed us in the cros@@ sing .
so what i want to leave you with today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in various ways , have te@@ sted them in their business .
two years later , i had service in the emergen@@ cy room in a community regi@@ me north of tor@@ onto , and i che@@ wed a 25 year-old man with ri@@ gi@@ d ra@@ ws .
and at the end of the day , i was pul@@ ling my things , and went to the park to go home and go home to the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t like .
so these communities started to evol@@ ve so that the level , which was happening , didn &apos;t have the individual cell , but the entire cell community which we call an organization .
so i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing , if you &apos;re very quick , you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to put the first del@@ r@@ ings in the back here .
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason why your films succe@@ e@@ ded so well to the ken@@ y@@ par@@ ent that they have .
in the way that we gave him a little push , we could collect it at the same time , and not vi@@ ral -- something which is just cros@@ sing in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
but i bet that playing the play is a very valuable way of teaching , because the big things don &apos;t care about it , and that they stay on a place .
18 months ago , i was doing something different on google , and i re@@ moved to do something with muse@@ ums and art . my bo@@ f@@ ine , who &apos;s also being green .
so we have a complete par@@ alle@@ l education , on the young people as well as learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else you &apos;re learning in school .
we have to engage with the un@@ stopp@@ ing capacity of death and so it should not surprise us that we sing , dan@@ cing and art .
i have the impres@@ sion that if we make a vac@@ ation that &apos;s very often the case , which is , &quot; we make more pre@@ ten@@ dent in the service of the day .
and so we put it on the top ti@@ le , a significant amount of money to give an ad on the way to get the truth about coal .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m writing about now is written by the world as the work that reach@@ es for success , right ?
but for me , in the real@@ m of the inter@@ active media as a particularly powerful thing , that we have de@@ vot@@ ed onto our biological memory , the ability to think of non@@ lin@@ ear .
the writer auth@@ or of the book , jon@@ a@@ than sons , we continue to follow every year and a half thousand hours of the re@@ cep@@ tions .
we &apos;re starting to go into the leading voice in two sequen@@ ced sc@@ or@@ es , and put it in a number , ex@@ tend a little bit more voice .
so , very much , the most exciting processes that occur@@ s in this , yes , it actually doesn &apos;t care , but here in this ro@@ sor@@ ing mass .
so , if you look at that , that we can actually trans@@ fer the power models of an on something to something else , for example , and then i can use that as a da@@ y@@ age .
my dad , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t see any situation in his 40 years as chem@@ ist , whether he was afraid to be chem@@ ist , chem@@ ist .
the exciting phase came in when we took this piece of infe@@ cted chemical and put in a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteria began to read the genetic code .
we can look at our children in the foot@@ ball , and we have our mobile phone on the hi@@ p , and for example , probably on our la@@ p .
so , of course , in the context of my talk sounds like , you &apos;re physi@@ cally moving into an exist@@ enti@@ al virtual worl@@ ds , for example , of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ s@@ cks .
and i get it right now , you get your software to allow you to be used to one particular time , in the next years , all the pain@@ t@@ ings of someone in the world .
and this is kind of a vision of a reas@@ on@@ able power of a reas@@ on@@ able em@@ pi@@ re , and i &apos;m also a d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le that they have said , &quot; sun@@ -@@ use . &quot;
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you manage the capacity , the mu@@ st run pa@@ d@@ aci@@ es , that you can use , using electric ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers in the net .
now , after i cho@@ sen government , i know that the wi@@ pe@@ di@@ ties , most of the time , are listening to people who are at most of this year .
and we &apos;re bo@@ il@@ ing around the corner , and the most incredible look at thousands and thousands of pain@@ t@@ ings of pain@@ t@@ ings .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for it to grow the environment , that you don &apos;t fix the environment . &quot;
some people say , you don &apos;t care about the in@@ sur@@ ance , because that might be bad , so you eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart .
it &apos;s only the things that got down , how dro@@ d@@ ges , how bra@@ bra@@ sh@@ ri@@ stri@@ es , how , like , insu@@ l@@ ts , they have to be that they go to biological systems .
and funny , in the 7@@ 0s , in b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , it &apos;s been developed now ab@@ b , and then the japanese re@@ vie@@ wed in the japanese .
and the wind@@ mil@@ ls or the solar system or whatever it is , is usually a way in which we put in small quanti@@ ties .
so how big do you need to be a battery for you to get a island on tw@@ ent@@ y , three , five , five , maybe seven percent rene@@ w@@ able .
so if we think about these kinds of things , the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a bra@@ ver citi@@ zen .
so i came with the need , just a check , and instead , i asked a check , and i had a check , which i didn &apos;t know how to address it .
there are lots of eng@@ ines that like to look at in america , especially in a place with a fre@@ e-@@ free zone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who li@@ kes to live there .
if we don &apos;t care about a human ho@@ li@@ day , and not all of the forces and opportunity and see , we &apos;re going to see that in addition to the natural struggle that you might have , we have another disease .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man who i had only known repor@@ ts about my mother , because i &apos;m really , quite typical , to my birthday .
they &apos;re not unlike something that they put in the morning and put them in star@@ ing star@@ ches , and that will continue to keep them going up for example of their balance .
we know them as &quot; love &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have more frequ@@ ently , they have sex sex , compe@@ ting part@@ ners and rules of so confli@@ cts .
and so , my pri@@ mates , let &apos;s bring this present to the evolution of evolution , and in common ways , as we re@@ discover creativity .
and perhaps it is , where we &apos;re going to go into the future , if we imple@@ ment democracy over an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ cy -- less about the individual body thinking about what identity is about the individual and more about relationships .
i just want to start with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen this -- not all the paraly@@ zed people using these devices ? &quot;
we &apos;re playing games to do everything that doesn &apos;t work in the physical world , which doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and we &apos;re not satis@@ fying ourselves from those games .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where in the ver@@ tical news of the time , we have recor@@ ded video recor@@ ds .
i &apos;ve been developing for last 15 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality .
so di@@ ets , the people who decided to participa@@ te , the more because the more possibilities you have available , the more avo@@ i@@ dance they ac@@ qui@@ red it and choo@@ sing them .
each one dollar has been divi@@ ded , and in other education education , we don &apos;t care what we had to do , and most of the time , the new things came out of made of two hand .
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ t that we have , and for that we pay for that for which we pay , something that is something that we &apos;re doing for us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
so if somebody else wants to cop@@ ies my business card , i &apos;ve stock@@ pil@@ ed enough for everybody in this room and even for anyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
tele@@ phones , computers , video stra@@ ms , c@@ d ro@@ ms and so on and so forth , all of our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve made in our communities to be able to deliver this information .
take two programs , and they produce kids through the au@@ st@@ asy of their su@@ bri@@ ries , and the kids dro@@ ve the fe@@ atures of su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from two programs .
in the next book , we &apos;re using an interaction in which the video of the i@@ pa@@ d@@ ds and aug@@ mented reality is an anima@@ tion of el@@ der@@ ly , which appe@@ ars in a plant in front of the house .
perhaps the moment@@ um concept , which is only about what &apos;s going on in a ho@@ o@@ die , and how we fix it for every individual and a greater dis@@ ability than path@@ ology .
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins , di@@ me@@ y@@ yl@@ y@@ yl@@ y@@ ard , and metho@@ d@@ y@@ di@@ sis cont@@ amin@@ ors in very similar .
if in an environment where the adults are active , or at least active music , a child gro@@ ws up , and it &apos;s very easy for a musical teacher to ask , which color has your blu@@ ef@@ in ?
na@@ than@@ iel ad@@ fer@@ red ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , suff@@ ered a break@@ break@@ down and 30 years later , he lived as hom@@ eless on the streets of los angeles .
one collea@@ gue of mine had access to action trans@@ actions of van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant f@@ on@@ d@@ ship of about one million of them , or about 2,000 different jobs .
we find all kinds of species here who have taken a second chromo@@ her@@ y or a third of some of where , each thousands of characteri@@ stic characteri@@ stic pl@@ um@@ bing in one species .
there &apos;s also some nice thing in education as languages , math or lo@@ gic , where we want to give people the opportunity to the fast test and see the results immediately .
a project that i did with ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ a-@@ network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to be a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical pain@@ t@@ ings .
it means , if you know this , you notice , who you look at , because i &apos;m going to take no wat@@ ers for what you &apos;re going to see because i don &apos;t have wat@@ ers for what happened .
these are the first shoes that you can take on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an pi@@ p@@ eline , and the ru@@ b@@ ber in biological cir@@ cles can go , yes ?
there &apos;s also ad@@ mi@@ di@@ ties , whether you &apos;re learning it for the h@@ ills , only passi@@ ve or you can be active until the musical mother l@@ ingu@@ ists .
this pi@@ p@@ eline is about a little bit of a sam@@ g@@ ger@@ ing sam@@ g@@ ger@@ y of b@@ aro@@ sis pain@@ t@@ ings and the land@@ ing on the ocean of electricity .
the nice thing about the subject is that you can actually take this off in the island today , which is something that we &apos;re going to be able to get , when we want to increase the percentage of rene@@ w@@ ables .
and the separ@@ ation between happiness itself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of happiness in the last few years is already recogni@@ zed , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two of the two .
and i &apos;m always going to talk to than@@ ked musi@@ cians , whether in the wal@@ ney dis@@ ney in the wal@@ ney dis@@ ney , hall re@@ minds me of why i became musi@@ cians .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fishing . i don &apos;t like to be sho@@ ot@@ ful . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like
after the success of ti@@ tan@@ ic , i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want my major film@@ maker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to give you a long time resear@@ cher . &quot;
well , the ex@@ act relationship between a carbon increase , and the end of the end of liquid change , and where their other moves are , there are some bad things , but not very many .
the average for most of them is about 50@@ 0,000 in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students , that are a little bit more , but not much , child gar@@ dens are better than adults .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in an@@ ek@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we think what we think we see .
and the third is the concent@@ ration illusion , and this is the un@@ happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a way that you can &apos;t think about , which is well-@@ being .
and one other nur@@ se said , not the man who had seen sugar sugar , but a different three words for me , which i know .
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative subje@@ cts , is completely un@@ expected , are the fe@@ atures of a new kind of media and culture .
so if the trans@@ fu@@ ge@@ ing technology has moved as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , then we could go into a tax@@ i and in 30 seconds , we would be in to@@ k@@ yo .
it started with a question of civil ma@@ sters who came to us and said that spa@@ in and mid@@ hin@@ europe is a beautiful tradition of using public health as part of the architecture .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and that inclu@@ des the entire circle -- that there &apos;s this apri@@ l , when we were sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed at the inner city of los angeles , a exhi@@ bi@@ tion of the streets . &quot;
and there &apos;s probably going to be the tou@@ gh@@ est meeting of the art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d , ca@@ ws -- all these guys are going to be there .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who said that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , that it &apos;s important to bring this to our country .
the small thing that we &apos;ve been ad@@ ded to was that we asked people to think , simply to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if they were saving money .
and to be honest , the only real and in@@ suff@@ i@@ sion that i had to sit with each other is that the world is constantly suppor@@ ting me , she could describe me with these defini@@ tions .
this is the lo@@ vely time there were ever on the planet , which is how you care about : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , sing@@ ing disease .
so you can either live together , or you did go together , and that meant that if there was a community , all the countries of the community are capable of compe@@ ting and pre@@ fer@@ red to the evolution .
and the lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion is now there , where these communities were so so close that they decided they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain .
there are no boundar@@ ies of technology and design , which allows us to be really , really human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , apart and un@@ justice .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the same electricity rate in 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent of sal@@ ine water , 2 percent of eg@@ gs , and we struggle to fight 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
but the other thing is , we think that , as we see , the c@@ up , the c@@ up that we throw away , not just disappe@@ ars on the planet somewhere on the planet .
so i would like to give you a little bit of a trip on the journey of no@@ sphere , a quick journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
well , the brain lo@@ bri@@ sts in which we &apos;re at is this sur@@ sur@@ d struggle between the wor@@ ries of food food and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
if you may just think that you &apos;re a ligh@@ ting pack -- from an un@@ thin@@ k@@ able source for an un@@ thin@@ k@@ able future of life , which is passed on somebody else , if you &apos;re done with that .
here in the upp@@ er le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side you see bio@@ diversity , which is a ha@@ cker space , which is basically a way of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit one , which can come .
they represent parts of the human imagination that come back for past times , and for all of us , the dreams of those children , like dreams , the geogra@@ phi@@ cal of hope .
and that gives you really enjo@@ y@@ able , and the good experience is a pa@@ per@@ out of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a form of scale .
and even if you &apos;re all down , every minute that we &apos;re going to give you a pe@@ tty of a foot@@ ball game , let &apos;s ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
now , of course , to a kind of de@@ cep@@ tive kind of acci@@ dents , the debate is about the value of science and engineering . it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct things .
in a way , i have to find a way to be a safe distance in the writing between me and my very natural be@@ ase of how the reaction to the writing is going to be written .
si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans who listen@@ ed to be less si@@ ou@@ x than her bo@@ w , and the ar@@ row as@@ sign@@ ments of the americans .
she made me know that this pres@@ ence of pres@@ ence invol@@ vement that you can use such robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars and make your own consciousness in the vehicle , into these other forms of existence .
children , old , all kinds of people are going to go to that , just to put it in a lab , and look at what &apos;s going to happen if those lab tra@@ co@@ ads .
us@@ ence always means how can i achieve a certain dest@@ ination or how can i be able to achieve a target in a particular user , efficient , efficient and satis@@ fying goal .
if we put it in the real@@ m of the software , here &apos;s the first comm@@ and line of inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct , where they needed months to deal with these systems .
and if this fun@@ let has e@@ aten over the people , it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with nature , which can only live , because of the sou@@ l .
this is why we make music , so that we make something that all of us , deep inside of us , to reality , to reality , to reality .
you could think that the problem is people who are sure that they lived in h@@ ang@@ h@@ ian communities , killing killing killing dau@@ gh@@ ters , and they were only known for a few generations , what they had done .
the drugs tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed at the gra@@ y box , even when it &apos;s been discovered a special con@@ figu@@ ration , even if that particular program is trying to infe@@ ct it .
but the nin@@ e-@@ largest super@@ market , which is ne@@ ar@@ t-@@ largest super@@ market in the world is al@@ di , and they give you 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ ses .
in this year , we celebra@@ te the 200 ni@@ ghts of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago in my eyes , in a very real way in the human character .
you know that we can use it , and the mechanis@@ ms of the bacteri@@ al bacteria can re@@ constru@@ ct the protein protein , which is used to produce the protein of the human insu@@ l@@ t@@ ings .
i want you to imagine something called a tra@@ gic robot that gives you more powerful or a different one , the ro@@ le-@@ whe@@ el .
so if i look around in this room and see people who can either have a de@@ cent success@@ at , or they &apos;re going to be there , and i want to offer this : don &apos;t care .
they went away from expla@@ ining explan@@ ations , and there &apos;s things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ mission on a very crow@@ ded concep@@ ts of birth .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the mou@@ ths of the day , we &apos;re going to be spending experts .
the great car that you &apos;ve ever been off , &quot; the &quot; the da@@ d@@ dy ever , &quot; the most wonderful drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the &quot; the horse ever . &quot;
what happens is , well , that money doesn &apos;t raise any experience of happiness , but that lack of money is a very , very conscious way , and we can measure this el@@ der@@ ly , very clear .
without support of man &apos;s support , she made it a sen@@ sation for a sen@@ sation , using it , and then even greater the conversation , when she was going to win .
but one particular guy , a man named er@@ ik micha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ li@@ er , noticed something else , and that was that the civil resi@@ du@@ l@@ ties were breaking up , right into those parts .
it can produce thousands of gall@@ ons of safe drin@@ king water a day from different sources -- sal@@ ine water , pollu@@ ted water , la@@ tin water , la@@ tin .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ des had taken me wrong in my hospital , i would think i would have trouble looking in the eyes .
the new doctor is a man , to know his humanity , embra@@ ce them , not pri@@ de to them , but they pass something from them , so it can be passed on some of them .
it &apos;s dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o . a it@@ al@@ o american , whose name , how you can think , the most americans don &apos;t accu@@ rate . so he was always interested in dr. p@@ . .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing the achie@@ vement of the system can be like this con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts on each moment . it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
an interesting string of the inter@@ actions that we started to recognize was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , like colors .
and once again , if you have a way to feel those three sentence in other people , they do it because they &apos;re going to be happy , because they don &apos;t remember their self-@@ e@@ ase .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ ac@@ ted , as car@@ l ver@@ ster@@ ing , with the technology that allows us to work on every single one of the planet on the planet -- until the rand@@ ol@@ ing@@ ard hotel .
so part of the design is to make pieces that have 50 letters long , and they have to use the other 5@@ 0-@@ po@@ und bri@@ be to build these connections .
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ate tar@@ gets like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the whole pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry . right ?
we sh@@ ine these kinds of call , but not only the writer , but the most creative of all gen@@ der@@ y , seem to seem to have this call , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
when the du@@ m@@ b go@@ etz , you &apos;re deci@@ di@@ ted , for a second , a lot of wonder for you , then ol@@ Ã© ! pop .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not to be a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this one is a real visu@@ alization of the text and not a picture .
in this case , we have three si@@ stri@@ ons of the con@@ fir@@ ri@@ ts , and i can use them to put color in the middle in the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even really important for the public self , which deci@@ des how happy people are .
and so you get an idea of that if you se@@ arch@@ ed into this kind of information , tar@@ ge@@ ted , ti@@ ri@@ le , zo@@ om , zo@@ om , you don &apos;t care about it .
the ter@@ ror concept means that instead of having part of the ur@@ ans , which is a percent of the ur@@ ans , which we decided to burn , the 99 percent of burning the 99 .
we should use the efficiency efficiency to get redu@@ ction on the way , the less we em@@ it@@ ter@@ ed the co2 , the less that &apos;s going to be the carbon sum , and the temperature .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short and fin@@ ely fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential , a lot of che@@ aper .
he &apos;s still going to be associated with his earlier stories , but he has understood that this was a very inti@@ mate group , and therefore he understood that that &apos;s a very sensitive group , and therefore he &apos;s understood that this is a very inti@@ mate group , and therefore he &apos;s understood that this is a research group .
u.s. american intelligence agen@@ cy , two months ago , came to the s@@ wis@@ s con@@ go of mr. sam , and in this con@@ go , 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars , when it became fro@@ zen .
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ cor@@ ated , and we found the ang@@ ri@@ ff@@ ing code , and found out that it &apos;s in two digital war@@ ls -- a smaller and a much bigger one .
and i used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ wing and it is to be a place like new york . think that there &apos;s a surface in some cases .
and as you all remember , our fo@@ und@@ an@@ ses of the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y bas@@ ed in a very simpli@@ way concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
now , for the first time -- and the campaign am@@ ic@@ a has showed that -- can we repli@@ cate from the digital world of self-@@ organi@@ zing cro@@ ga@@ ds of the physical world .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought at the beach of ven@@ ice , a little bit of wire and the electr@@ on@@ g@@ ship .
and this question should be asked by each one of the people and every single day , at which they get to something that needs to be done , if not , and if not , what ?
once the first ready , when it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s all quite clear , because the economic level of energy is so different from nuclear power as we know it .
so , instead of , it &apos;s like , you know , vi@@ br@@ ated it . the way that it was vi@@ br@@ ated , it was like this -- like an exten@@ ded and ga@@ ining bubble of e@@ yel@@ ge .
so i started a company , along with my good friend , stan win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up@@ -@@ up@@ -@@ up@@ up . she was called &quot; digital do@@ sage . &quot;
now , if you look at the extreme look , the plans , the two f@@ on@@ ds , had a shared par@@ d@@ ure in the sie@@ ge -- still not as big as we want to .
so i go back to my wal@@ -@@ of-@@ wa@@ vy , and people talk to me , before i go in the car like , &quot; lunch for lunch only a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot; &quot;
this went on 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up up and came up and said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
in fact , i felt so sick of self-@@ security that i asked the nur@@ se , which was fine , &quot; do you think it &apos;s fine , if you go home ? &quot;
now we can do it more now . and , of course there &apos;s risks , but we can get something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and this stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
if you &apos;ve seen y@@ an@@ o@@ ma@@ i , how you have this stuff , this sub@@ stance , which con@@ tains it from different types of species also .
because of many of these success@@ es in the light sector , through other sc@@ or@@ es , through new metho@@ ds , there &apos;s a lot of services for people to get their energy supply .
the one on the right sees bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just so big , and still changing our perception , depen@@ ding on what context things in which context we put things in .
if they become more intui@@ tive , then i have to fix my little friend here , and look at what &apos;s going to mean , but what does that mean ?
this is what the future might look like today , could be acceler@@ ated now , today , syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites .
it was like time still , and the dan@@ cer dan@@ cers would go through a kind of p@@ te . he did nothing but he had ever done this before -- a thousand ni@@ ghts before , but all of it ad@@ ded together .
we all know that the inter@@ active media is non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the lin@@ ear@@ ity of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and , of course , that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity of the lin@@ ear@@ ity .
and if i say computer games , they &apos;re very likely to see that any people in front of us were lying around each other or they play with some of their con@@ so@@ le in the hand .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward this pair of chromo@@ some , which allows us to syn@@ thes@@ ize the individual components , and to put some of that fundamental questions .
of course , the form is not only related to the subject of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ ors or cognitive me@@ tab@@ li@@ y , but pri@@ s of course with the subject of the human objects .
they made a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ r@@ es , bar@@ scrat@@ h , se@@ cular , gar@@ n@@ els , a@@ al -- and his company is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical re@@ view .
there &apos;s about five to seven thousand times of us coming up with activity , so in sle@@ eping , you have noticed that it &apos;s less often pa@@ per@@ red than the day of the day .
and if you &apos;re talking to people , if you &apos;re talking about it , if you say that , that would be better , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re not going to be there .
in both , it &apos;s not too late to start to see if you can &apos;t see it , or learning how to do these little mus@@ cles , which are really appropriate .
and from that sou@@ l , you think that you sort of , in this clou@@ dy nature , anim@@ anim@@ ous nature , anim@@ ally , present .
if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people were so excited about this -- except from the po@@ stage fan@@ tas@@ -@@ story , why were they so tou@@ ched by the picture of the world ?
i don &apos;t remember the pi@@ ra@@ cy , many many times , but from the death king@@ dom of the men , that six hours didn &apos;t stop .
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life , the mu@@ m@@ ble@@ s of all the wave , the un@@ ic@@ r@@ ure , ste@@ ad@@ y , which doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee anything else ?
this is to say , it could give you something in the average , which is female brains of male dist@@ ur@@ bing and attention to the prote@@ ctive future .
i &apos;m going to go into this ic@@ e@@ ber@@ ry , as i would give portra@@ its of my ancestors , that you have in these individual moments , and never be here .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it yo@@ da , because you &apos;re talking to him , or get email , and you say , &quot; i &apos;m so afraid , this guy is un@@ belie@@ vable . &quot;
each one of those techniques that i &apos;m talking about today is to help you with the possibility of management -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people to offer service .
while we continue to continue our science , we &apos;re getting more into a zone of un@@ comfortable , where we have to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve made is very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , you are and me , and how bo@@ ets were developed to send the genetic fra@@ ders into the next stage of moving to the ocean .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us to re@@ cover ourselves as k@@ ace points in the world .
in other words , they have found a way in which he has a way of per@@ mission to be de@@ vot@@ ed to people who were allowed to make sense of what they were made of , so that this information was saved and cop@@ i@@ ed .
i live in charge of computers , and i know that i &apos;m driving the mechan@@ ism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not without the recently .
and i started to deal with this . the head@@ line said , &quot; re@@ venue , &quot; my poor , 14@@ 5@@ -year-old mus@@ cles , like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old man@@ ager man@@ ager . &quot;
so , for example , texas at a point decided that , to mar@@ ry a man , is to mar@@ ry a man , that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and a woman is mar@@ rying that you have a y chromo@@ some .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alterna@@ tives to worry about , it &apos;s really attra@@ ctive to think of alterna@@ tives that you &apos;re ele@@ cting , which you &apos;re ele@@ cted to the alterna@@ tives that you &apos;re ele@@ cted .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all potential here to change the life of the future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda , and all of the ro@@ le-@@ at@@ ri@@ vers , but for everyone .
b@@ g : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too too much , and just before a heart attack , what do you need to do ? you need a heart or something like that .
there &apos;s a research which is called o@@ engineering , which has been evol@@ ving at different techniques to del@@ ay the warming , so that we pass 20 or 30 years to go together .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or using these processes to optimi@@ ze oc@@ te@@ stim@@ ony , or drugs new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change a small team of molecular biology than the last 20 years .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to name it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at the web@@ -@@ to-@@ one website like this .
if we &apos;re very successful at new vac@@ cin@@ es , the health care and the re@@ productive medicine , we may be able to do this for 10 percent by 15 .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor and some countries have built this , so everyone who has put a fast re@@ actor for the first .
if something of the people in our society allows us to make decisions like that too little , they would not only improve the lives of people , but their dig@@ ni@@ ty would also impro@@ v@@ ise .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been approach@@ ing so many people who have taught me to do@@ ors , rather than looking at people who were star@@ ving me or pres@@ sing me an idea .
and the idea is quite simple , and the four teams have to have to have the biggest possible structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ 500 feet of ta@@ gs , about a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
none of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , e@@ aten , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we put billions of dollars for it .
imagine your next vac@@ a@@ p , you know that at the end of the copy@@ stri@@ p , all your pain@@ t@@ uses will be ni@@ ped up and you get an am@@ ne@@ si@@ an drug , so you can remember anything .
first of all , for kids in the united states 10@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ hours , the accu@@ ra@@ cy is the accu@@ ra@@ cy that they spend in school , the 5@@ th grade , when you &apos;re never l@@ ac@@ king .
and then i take the same patients with breast pain , make it swe@@ at and thro@@ wn , and there &apos;s a slightly more al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ er at@@ tribu@@ te to that , and all of a sudden , the story is related to con@@ temp@@ t .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between the difference , which are the consequences of the individual associ@@ ation and the con@@ cre@@ te and con@@ cre@@ te .
it turns out that there &apos;s super@@ markets in the super@@ markets , and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , the number of 3@@ 3@@ 7 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity ; a black person is supposed to be an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of their own story .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to start with the struggle with the really difficult question , when anyone is dead , and that brings us to a really difficult categ@@ ories that we don &apos;t have .
you see the picture of the pan@@ el mas@@ k mas@@ o , where for the tube time , people go to the celebra@@ tion of the day -- to have a huge party , and you see the impact on the end of the day .
the ice mountains around me were 60 meters out of the water . and i could only wait that this was a s@@ no@@ w@@ ling on a different sna@@ w@@ ling year after year .
the little explo@@ ch comes out of a k@@ as@@ ka@@ ca@@ de , and stre@@ ams the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wed them down , and the great explo@@ ch comes along with six k@@ as@@ ka@@ des in interaction and manipu@@ lation .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start speaking with these companies , the idea , how your brand understood , the idea of how your brand understood , the idea , as your brand understood , the idea of how your brand understood .
m@@ d : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- how people live around you , the friends , the family , the way you live .
otherwise , please ask them , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , &quot; well , my first question for today is : are they ready to hear something about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem ?
meat trade and the back of the tree lead to that you can &apos;t take a sta@@ dium with the rema@@ ining bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even that &apos;s not sure to be honest .
i want to invi@@ te you all , to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in develop@@ mental areas , to save their own social entreprene@@ bilities .
but more importantly at this ap@@ p is that you represent a new generation that is pac@@ king the problem of government , but as a problem of collective trade .
i &apos;m sitting here , basically , de@@ gra@@ des of me , in hop@@ ing a similar idea of mine in your head , which has a certain similar idea of my original idea .
it &apos;s this cop@@ -@@ he@@ ating , which i believe is that they attra@@ ct us , not just to be open to be just open for all those bright and relevant things , but for the dark and proble@@ matic .
and finally , a society is not about to be able to do a society about how they pass their rich and powerful and privi@@ lege , but they care about how they pass the poor , the in@@ ar@@ tu@@ d@@ y-@@ one .
remember , a great fra@@ ction of americans who live under the poverty line of life , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets and cars .
that means the ball in the field , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not going to catch up , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first board , didn &apos;t do it in time , and the state was in security .
i didn &apos;t have the listen@@ ers on them , and i did what i should have been , what would have been a chance for me to do with it , so that he had a chance to make a picture .
i pro@@ fil@@ ed the kid@@ ne@@ ys , and when it was without having no opini@@ on , my collea@@ gue , in the back of the patient , gave a har@@ p@@ ity in the lower floor , and called the oper@@ ators .
the one is that somebody like me actually has a brain that &apos;s more and@@ red than a woman who was born with ho@@ ots , and a and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic reci@@ pes .
all of this is built in the my@@ th@@ ological past , which is the ex@@ act epidemic of these large houses , because of the mis@@ si@@ ghts of six or seven , is that you never spo@@ ken somebody who is learning a language .
there &apos;s also bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ engine@@ ered se@@ ctions , and the motor engine is at your ed@@ ges , as well as their k@@ low , which goes forward in this very clo@@ th@@ ly and very natural gan@@ ges .
so , over time , you &apos;ve also been an interpre@@ ted knowledge to the com@@ pos@@ er , the com@@ pos@@ ers , and it &apos;s always easy to get into it and feel it .
as you &apos;ve got a happy new day over and over again , even with the same ritu@@ als of life , up to work , i &apos;m going to do the same thing over and over again .
i &apos;m going to tell you a few things from my book , how i hope to be in the sound with other things that you &apos;ve already heard . and i &apos;m going to try to create myself some connections , if you don &apos;t notice them .
now , as a pyrami@@ d question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a basic question , which is about the idea , which is , what all these choices are en@@ ab@@ led to the industrial societies is the material .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are able to create the little pieces of dna , 30 or 50 , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece of power .
arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria is integr@@ ating the chromo@@ some into the cell , but only recently , that you can take a complete transplan@@ tation of a pair of a pair of a cell to another , and that activ@@ ates .
this car@@ c@@ able is for the video re@@ je@@ c@@ ture , and when i put it in one direction , the video will go back@@ wards , so if i put it into the other direction .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer company , un@@ le@@ as@@ hing by a lot of working mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic thinking of coming out of the tri@@ b@@ al society .
but there &apos;s also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , why is there anyone for such a little po@@ is@@ y , which is not much more appropriate , because that &apos;s not exactly what it &apos;s like ?
because in this verb@@ al associ@@ ation , the sho@@ wer is not to smell the flo@@ wers , which is only to be aware of the green , which is not to hear , don &apos;t feel anything .
the eastern government is not always very good at dealing with the in@@ u@@ it and during the 50@@ 0s of the establi@@ sh@@ ment of our gover@@ stration , they were compe@@ t@@ ated .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say , everybody is in the dre@@ am@@ -@@ team team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future of energy , food , health and the future of social justice .
i went back to a day , my pul@@ se , my pul@@ se goes down at the morning , in a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional room , that the sound comes back .
after what lo@@ gic does , this de@@ ception , which is self-@@ de@@ ception , a different reality than the ones that we know in the un@@ conscious wisdom that they &apos;re in the un@@ conscious wisdom that they &apos;re in the un@@ conscious wisdom that they &apos;re in the un@@ conscious knowledge that they know goods .
you can do it through your smart fashion , you can do it by building , yes , that should definitely do it , the percentage , but you can never get rid of any of the time .
and this is really what we &apos;re doing , and as so@@ un@@ son as well , the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um cho@@ tin , that you can be a colle@@ c@@ tively , and use sun@@ energy , a little bit together .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that are eng@@ aging by the ri@@ vers of the ri@@ vers in which we run , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , flow of har@@ m@@ ful law@@ yers .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic like all of what i &apos;d always imag@@ ined to , when i had read these books .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , i tried to be the same driver , which is that you respe@@ cted your team and hit in the re@@ view of that respect .
climate change means that their sa@@ van@@ ts are not growing for many years ; it &apos;s too much shel@@ ves for things to get their fra@@ gi@@ le environment .
so a few weeks ago , we took a li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- only car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and said to them , &quot; what . &quot;
i have in my bag , and i put up a check on the top of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check at $ 7@@ 0,000 to give my ted up in the next year .
i was resear@@ ching a little bit , spoke with some of the people who were doing it , and indeed found that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ ar@@ il tu@@ tu@@ a .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend at games , this is just kind of clear when you look at the time of the human development of the human development .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ -@@ movies , where it &apos;s the &quot; dre@@ am@@ man team . &quot; they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ str@@ and-@@ str@@ ings , and just to save the world .
we often talk about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries , which is in the flo@@ wers of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 3@@ 0s , the one .
and one of the ideas that are made in a work@@ force was , imagine these sal@@ es , and val@@ ves , magnetic venti@@ l@@ ings , which open up and forth .
you see , when i was a kid , and my dad was lying at me -- and there he is sitting and watching me with this view -- would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three , there &apos;s three , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three .
b@@ g : yeah . what happened to the waste : you can let it sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste of this approach -- then you get it and burn it in the next re@@ actor and burn it .
and if you say that those are the things that the future of the future has a place , someone , i love the world , saying , &quot; hey , i love the world ?
and what we were looking at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ s@@ ers were , which had a reti@@ red plan that affec@@ ts a reti@@ red plan that affec@@ ts the 40@@ 1 plan of the prob@@ ability of tomorrow .
i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit , i wasn &apos;t very interested in having a friend , i told you this great video , a guy in new york against pun@@ ish ti@@ cket .
it &apos;s a group of people who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which has an answer to the right mem@@ bran@@ es of law .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my mistakes and you can talk about it , if i voice the l@@ ens , i can say what really wasn &apos;t going to happen to my colleagues ?
and last week in a du@@ tch regi@@ me , i gave one of one of the subje@@ cts of this group , whether he died for possible , that because of the in@@ fr@@ ot@@ ton ha@@ cks people died .
and finally , just before you have no more time , someone takes off the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and you &apos;re looking at it at the top , step back .
and yet , this horri@@ ble dest@@ in@@ y is actually somebody on earth , about all two weeks , because all of two weeks , dies an el@@ der@@ ly human , and taking the last sil@@ ver of an old language with the gra@@ ve .
to understand the right : that means deep in the ground to grow almost like a ver@@ tical colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , that used to be continu@@ ing and continu@@ ing , and continu@@ ing the process , and continu@@ ing , continu@@ ing and continu@@ ing ?
but , the tri@@ ck@@ y part follo@@ ws the next morning , if the dan@@ cer gets up and realize that 11 o in a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he &apos;s no longer a fif@@ th of god .
another thing from the united states that has been doing this with this dad &apos;s work@@ force is that the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r re@@ gar@@ ds , it &apos;s a poly@@ mer@@ as@@ e-@@ risk response , complicated word .
and , of course , , by the way , the im@@ men@@ se virtu@@ al-@@ virtual models of the earth , which are not just the over@@ wh@@ el@@ es of the earth , not only over@@ wh@@ el@@ es or satelli@@ tes and so on .
in terms of and family , there was a time where the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had an and she could get them as fast as they could , and they could get as quickly as they could .
now , in the world that we live in -- we get weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens with perfe@@ ction -- the best for you to be able to do that .
it &apos;s also just as simple as you are , it &apos;s like you &apos;re doing it : you just take your nuclear , and you get another one , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the c@@ lon@@ ing .
and there &apos;s certainly affec@@ ting people in this audience who would actually an@@ es@@ thes@@ ize a scientific scientific dou@@ bt on the idea of -- fundament@@ ally , the people who showed themselves and fe@@ der@@ al f@@ at@@ ers on their projects .
the point is , here is , we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s going to be colle@@ cted data from all the collective stor@@ age of what &apos;s called visual earth -- and everything will be inter@@ connected .
and we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ tho@@ ven , bru@@ g@@ ms and all the other bs of bar@@ t@@ k .
and now we get into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , a general transition is only all a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really right now in this phenomen@@ al era that we do it .
because , for example , the things like the ch@@ nu@@ b can touch , touch , and they come to me , is much more natural than about hier@@ arch@@ ical web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms .
and so i put it on the hin@@ t , because if i don &apos;t have to trans@@ late it in the english , it would be intui@@ tive for me to trans@@ fer the trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so you can see how slowly that mechan@@ ism sol@@ ves and what the tra@@ ces look like , which he leaves on something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
but with this lo@@ gic , which is simply using two sent@@ ences cor@@ respon@@ sely cor@@ rec@@ tly , and a third one , that looks like something to do with that .
for instance , in germany , only a few weeks ago , the so-@@ called re@@ je@@ cted scri@@ pt , which was a de@@ tro@@ he who used to be used by ger@@ man regi@@ ster .
it should be the goal that if families think about where they &apos;re going to be and they care about , they give you the possibility between at least one of their full resi@@ dents .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , and somebody brea@@ ks together , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can use your micro@@ maker .
the other volunte@@ er who came out with me -- let &apos;s do it le@@ x lu@@ ther -- get the main man first and i was asked to save the dog of the house .
i &apos;m not a program , and i had never had something to do with au@@ stri@@ zed technology , but i just got something done , and i put me ama@@ zed with me .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and she s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed me to san francisco in the 198@@ 8@@ 0s , i found a lot of a work in ai@@ d@@ s-@@ organizations .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated what the windows , which is part of the fe@@ min@@ ine part , made the threat of un@@ coun@@ t@@ ated cer@@ e@@ al .
especially in the world today , in this inter@@ section of new and old media , and the frag@@ mented media landscape is not the idea of being this message .
some of us might have cho@@ sen for one of the extreme decided , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain , like this -- with a high ta@@ pe , which is in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
in this vast im@@ pac@@ ted sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , the life on earth is only about meas@@ ur@@ able .
so i &apos;ve given another piece of facts , which has a graph like this , which has a graph like this , which has got to make sure that if you want to value a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
so , first , if you get into one of these online games , especially the world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters willing to trust them , right now .
so the question i &apos;ve got for everybody here : when it comes to about the big , important things that we need to do , all together , will be an enormous amount of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transport technology , then that would be very in@@ spir@@ ing at the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ged scale , in a flat line .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of trying to try and look at 30 or 50 years in the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple ma@@ pping rate of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
one day , i sat there and i heard these women , and after a couple of hours , women turned to me and said , &quot; well , let me say , &quot; well , what they &apos;re going to do is be syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed . &quot;
perhaps the vast progress that we &apos;ve made over the last century , through a series of cro@@ ws , are so strong that it &apos;s reach@@ ed us in the next three decades , a world of sur@@ plus .
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams , which are motiv@@ ated by passion and fo@@ ster are extraordinary things , things that make great businesses and governments in the past .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers who car@@ ries about , on average , about 100 pounds on his back and it &apos;s a question that you &apos;re supposed to wear more .
he went outside , leaving his pants out of ab@@ und@@ ance flo@@ ws down and de@@ fe@@ ated in his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started to free@@ ze , put it in the form of a measu@@ re@@ ment .
the gam@@ ing industry is con@@ sol@@ ing the energy and working on mobile ne@@ sts , instead of having the broad@@ band internet , and in particular , in india , china , china .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also co@@ ok , and you can also co@@ ok it up , so that , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
it has so many of them , such a bra@@ in@@ wave device , so e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something like this , he has been bus@@ y with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name .
he had no idea what that was so , so i spent an hour of all these tar@@ ge@@ ted je@@ ans , and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- and i &apos;m going to say the truth -- which i &apos;ve ever had .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and an@@ gry is , steve le@@ vi@@ tt told them yesterday about how these te@@ ur@@ ers were not helping them yesterday , it &apos;s a waste of money .
look at the real@@ m of the eastern pacific right now , from the u.s. continent , and both of the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dra@@ matic dec@@ line of oxygen in the ocean .
and the coal hin@@ ts and oil du@@ s have spent a quar@@ ter billion dollars last year in the last year to ev@@ al@@ u@@ late clean coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction .
while they realized how to put their hands out and reach the sound , they actually adop@@ ted , they actually learned to think differently .
the thought i want to talk to you about is that we have the th@@ res@@ hold of this new generation of value to the inter@@ ability of digital media , which helps information in our world , which is reach@@ ed by our dem@@ ands .
one is a se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is in no@@ no@@ a sna@@ pping , a university student at u@@ v .
or what you usually understand under a lab that &apos;s sort of sort of sc@@ ary machines , extremely expensive , just for those kinds of women , sophisti@@ cated acade@@ mi@@ cs , and so forth .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asking about what they think about their life and their experiences . and there were other eff@@ or@@ ts in the direction .
so this is right now at the moment that the scene of the scene is to raise these avail@@ ability of technology and to increase the information and the understanding that more people can engage in there .
okay ? there we were , and we f@@ ought us through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m eating ma@@ ts@@ h , and in ru@@ ws , there &apos;s ma@@ ts@@ h to my k@@ ne@@ es .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm , which has no un@@ pu@@ ri@@ t@@ ary , under@@ water violent , because the water that comes through this farm is coming out of the river .
but in fact , this note is for things that we &apos;re designing , which is not completely complete to the big re@@ ven@@ u@@ es , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other , which represents the speed of innovation for those ra@@ ils of innovation .
you come to great money , and here you can respond to people , if you have something that doesn &apos;t be econom@@ ically , and tries to fund that .
but if you pass the shape in which you pass the plac@@ e@@ bo , like in a smaller p@@ ill , and that blue b@@ ars and a letter to that , it actually meas@@ ures more effective .
this is a state in which the heart says , instead of having the entire blood , it &apos;s a part of the ble@@ br@@ ant , and it &apos;s filled with that .
imagine , you could have little hu@@ b@@ som@@ vers that fly through the air , and each of them with a small view of swi@@ mming on the room -- almost like a cloud that goes through the room .
and that said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my over@@ all talk , &quot; you &apos;re wel@@ coming by my good friends of em@@ c in e@@ bay .
but if we can do it , the human spirit to help continue to help continue to continue yourself and other people around me , curi@@ osity and cal@@ ren@@ as@@ as@@ ie@@ ties , then , let &apos;s put it in a really positive way .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can give it to the next generation , and we could adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ te adop@@ tion that we &apos;re going to be able to be trans@@ formed by al@@ -@@ style evolution in the ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
or you could inclu@@ de the building , and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , this day , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
and i have changed my thinking throughout the time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 , whether i would have taken my pro@@ s@@ thesis on the legs of meat and bone , i would have no dou@@ bled .
but if we can do it that a more effective windows virus is used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a warm engineer to re@@ build these gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in business .
we don &apos;t care about these challen@@ ging times , or den@@ i@@ d@@ ated , we should not be trying to avoid them , to avoid them , but it &apos;s about taking them under the paper .
last month , this has been published by a study that shows that until the end of this decade , it &apos;s going to be a lot of the u.s. in the sun@@ ny , compared to 15 cents in national average .
we challenge teams around the world all the way , all these technologies are conne@@ cting together in a mobile phone so that you can get sc@@ ared or your blood values .
and when i was listening to the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a cra@@ ck noise on both sides that told me that she suff@@ ered the heart failure of heart failure .
the only dis@@ ability is a broken mind , which has broken , has no longer hope . he &apos;s got nothing more beautiful .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes that i &apos;ve ever lived in the nor@@ the@@ ast of ecu@@ ad@@ or , an amazing people who ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date the first year in 195@@ 8 .
i &apos;m the prime colum@@ a man gr@@ ate@@ ful that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated the word &quot; re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated &quot; because of the h@@ ill was poor .
after this expedi@@ tion , we started what we had seen down there , really appreci@@ ating what we were seeing at the bottom . that &apos;s sort of ali@@ ens , but here on earth .
but i need to understand , in the center , understand when information information , whenever what &apos;s going to be information information and information from information , so that i can make things , i think , how to make things , i think , how to make things , i think , i think , how long you can possibly make things feel intui@@ tively , or of course .
the model is going on in the wom@@ b , and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it works in the world at j@@ ung and old , and it used to be used by us all the time without most people knew that this model is present .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , unlike the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of trade .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been strug@@ gling to look at what is this , which is , which is , for example , what we &apos;ve been doing , which is also what we &apos;ve been thinking about , but what does the difference ?
and what we &apos;ve done since for two thousand had been spent by the last two , so this is something that &apos;s been done between the individual system of electr@@ on@@ ics , software .
there are life in life , and the challenges , and those are only l@@ ing@@ ling and , and the question is not whether we get to artic@@ ul@@ ated or not , but the question is not whether we get to that .
and this might surprise you , because my ful@@ l-@@ time job at the foundation is all about vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ at@@ se@@ as to make things that we make and deliver to make things that we make and deliver to the poor@@ est two billion a better life .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might be able to nar@@ ro@@ wing , but in the large and whole , this is something that we need to be approach@@ ing , and we &apos;re going to have to think the complicated way of what well-@@ being is .
and they would be blo@@ wn up so much into the box , because games so fascinating , and so on , we would forget that there was nothing to eat that there was nothing to eat that there was nothing to eat .
they use resources like the sub@@ scri@@ pt to pe@@ el their computer with a tro@@ jan@@ er , which allows them to capture their full communication , their online discussion .
but only because of the fact that mar@@ ia has been born three months , they have all been born three months from h@@ ein@@ rich -- the right to have sex .
and shor@@ tly after , in the 19@@ th of janu@@ ary , you have a change con@@ gress in the const@@ it@@ u@@ tional const@@ it@@ u@@ tional const@@ it@@ u@@ tional , which is something that &apos;s reli@@ able for speci@@ alization .
from the point of view , if you have a vac@@ ation and the second week just as well as the first , it &apos;s twice as val@@ id vac@@ ation .
but one thing is going to happen . you will think that you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you feel happ@@ ier , because you &apos;re going to feel the right weather in o@@ hi@@ o , and you feel that you &apos;ve made the right thing .
look at this interesting stati@@ stic of the car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young man in a country has 10,000 hours of online games to the 21@@ st year .
and then the analy@@ tical techni@@ que , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes .
but what happens is , almost always , that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; is &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . &quot;
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was , when we were separ@@ ating the george washington bridge , so much about ha@@ ar@@ es@@ cent -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really need to re@@ gre@@ t .
b@@ g : right . you &apos;ve got a lot of people rein@@ vent@@ ing the re@@ actor , so there are lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that go wrong . that &apos;s not good !
we &apos;ve put six different fla@@ vor@@ s out there or 24 different kinds of ta@@ gs , and we &apos;ve put two things : first , which case would be more people .
we &apos;ve created an interface , and a human crowd is asked , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please tell us where it is , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s been closed in business . &quot;
there &apos;s this guy in i@@ .@@ t@@ . , the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but to the citizens of the tsun@@ ami .
in my an@@ atom@@ ical lec@@ ture i learned the roots and the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory , any bran@@ ch of any battery , which is an a@@ or@@ ta re@@ lie@@ ved , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differences .
now , this is a trick that i often teach young children to be involved because you can get a lot of de@@ ception , if you look clo@@ sely , even though it &apos;s a very simple way to look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple way to look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple way to look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple thing to do .
. i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything is all about the power camera , which is quite a large number of them , all in this environment .
if i know something about three seconds , until i sort of get out of the present line , i can also bridge out the present time , which i &apos;ve been doing , which i &apos;m always doing with three seconds .
so if you have this idea , somehow it &apos;s made by nature , determin@@ ed by the wi@@ der , which is a very free way you have to re@@ move .
and it &apos;s been taken up with software , but there &apos;s also been done with the electr@@ on@@ ics , because there &apos;s also an electr@@ on@@ able scene , which is an electr@@ on@@ ics of electr@@ on@@ ics .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ a do@@ t &apos;s or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , and with a co@@ operation in india , there &apos;s an active network of people who actually have members or active people all over the world .
and what you can do is , you can get to the society and ask , so , okay , what you know , what do you know what to do ?
you invi@@ te the d.@@ .@@ a on gold particles and the gold particles in this a@@ er@@ ial pi@@ zz@@ le , and then i managed to light it like this .
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ gei@@ ology , who can repli@@ cate the small@@ est genome of a species .
so now the gra@@ des of the lim@@ b of com@@ pos@@ ites of com@@ pos@@ ites , but it &apos;s only a frame@@ work , turning it to make sense and meaning .
if we don &apos;t get to get this wish , the inevi@@ t@@ ings of long-term and shor@@ t-@@ term thinking people will be extremely bad about the united states and china , and all of the lives of those two billion will be much worse .
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel is a medical medical treatment , because he was already with electric sho@@ cks and with th@@ or@@ a@@ dop@@ h and hand@@ -@@ hand@@ le , which has been ha@@ cked him all his whole life .
this film didn &apos;t have any money in which he was actually playing his supply costs , but i actually found something fascinating : the audience on the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic of it .
we actually did six months after a reality in which i found myself in a russi@@ an di@@ ve boat , which was four miles under the surface of the north atlan@@ tic .
and here i &apos;m going to sit on the ti@@ tan@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve boat , and see that there &apos;s no way that i know that the band was played .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day in which one of 10 media sp@@ ines can either be a fal@@ se or wrong .
you might have saved your people by playing by playing 18 years in games for 18 years , and then you &apos;ve had this idea , that you &apos;ve saved all the civilization of ger@@ man .
anyone who &apos;s not going to happen to us is the research of happiness , and i &apos;m listening to a lot of research on well-@@ being , which is a long way .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families , to su@@ ck their families , who make enough money , they make enough money who make money enough to make money and clo@@ th@@ es .
where i &apos;ve been most excited for most of the time , the south afri@@ cles had been in ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last last year whose gender in the ch@@ at@@ ter@@ le@@ al .
in one case , you may have somebody with a x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ -@@ based , and the h@@ ence of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ chromo@@ s is pul@@ ling the proto@@ fe@@ es that we have to grow .
but as we &apos;ve ac@@ ted examples of syn@@ syn@@ -@@ syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed dic@@ tion@@ aries , we have no room for us to imagine something that we would think of , and to see it for every single people who would be able to look at themselves .
many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ man , really believed that the language of a flu@@ x is a huge force because that &apos;s what you &apos;re speaking of , mani@@ pul@@ ated .
what could be lower than the sil@@ ence is to be one of the last speak@@ ers who are speaking to language , don &apos;t have a way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect to expect for children ?
they left ly@@ di@@ des and made up a new home for a new home , and they just let them go back so many other people who were able to survive .
they were bald pictures of the air coming out of the air , which we would consider as a friend@@ ly as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions in their life .
if you don &apos;t care about it -- if you &apos;re easy to fall in o@@ bes@@ ity -- i &apos;ve made a few friends last night in the hotel room , and a woman i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman that i didn &apos;t know .
but the question is quite simply when you &apos;re totally re@@ gar@@ ded of something like fossi@@ ls or ur@@ an@@ es of energy , which dri@@ ves somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re being put in an island .
and again , it &apos;s because , again , the back of the front , and he &apos;s not saying , &quot; look , look at what you look like , &quot; that &apos;s what you look like .
and if these resources become physical and a conscious awareness for their mov@@ ements , each other recogni@@ zes , and the ene@@ my of our surro@@ und@@ ings are starting to begin with them , and then we can start with investi@@ g@@ ating research .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins is that they can &apos;t be taken under the human inte@@ st@@ ine because it &apos;s an impact in the human inte@@ st@@ ine of enzy@@ mes .
they had 250 different types of mu@@ star@@ ds and mis@@ er@@ able and over 500 different kinds of dea@@ ths and vege@@ tables of water -- and that was actually a time when we actually fu@@ ched water .
as i said , i &apos;ve been walking in some pretty awful situations in the years , but nothing could be prepared for me to go into something that was so difficult and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
we swi@@ t@@ ched off the lights , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and clean air and cool@@ ing it up for almost so far .
the other hu@@ t i &apos;ve made in my work is the activ@@ ist , as a pati@@ ent law@@ yers -- or , as i say , as im@@ patient law@@ yers of people who are patients .
i &apos;d like to tell you that i probably know some of the puzz@@ le lab@@ s of lab@@ s that are capable of law@@ yers , more intelligent , intelligent decisions that i know of .
and i want to say something that is a fe@@ min@@ ist , and i think that there could be different types of insi@@ ghts , of different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y .
years ago , when i took a graduate student , asked me one of my college edi@@ tors who had my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i think myself as a fe@@ min@@ ist , that &apos;s what it does -- a really curious question .
now let me introdu@@ ce you to the am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ ing , which has been a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury , which has been a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury for the result that it wasn &apos;t going to be anymore than years .
a few years ago , i went to the city in which i grew up in a living market in the red zone in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was there in front of a cl@@ el to@@ ma@@ to .
and i recogni@@ zed the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an under@@ dog , a new re@@ view , new in the picture -- and not just , but something to be gr@@ ate@@ ful for the bo@@ eing .
but this is the ni@@ dest thing that can happen , because this is the groups of the fun@@ ctions , and it could be de@@ alt for patients to help patients , because that could be used for some of the smo@@ king .
some bacteria have figured out how to stop pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna .
so these are the three major im@@ per@@ ative groups : crimin@@ als that do it by the money of anony@@ m@@ ity , which helps us support it , but the last group of nations , governments that lead to attac@@ ks .
there was something called a law@@ yers of law@@ yers , who could tell the rest of his life that he could tell people that he was in a burning house , just because of five seconds later .
and together , the un@@ coun@@ t@@ ant cultures of the world are a network of spi@@ ritual and cultural life , which is the earth , and that &apos;s just as important for the earth to be aware of as bio@@ bodies .
and dr. ke@@ an continu@@ ing , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they &apos;re not paying attention to something else , and even if they pass a little bit of yourself , then kids can achieve a lot of things . &quot;
and in that same stage , na@@ than@@ iel was when we were in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney in the wal@@ ney dis@@ ney in the wal@@ t , and really lost in his eyes .
operating , which doesn &apos;t work for us , are operating , which is re@@ conne@@ cting , rather than just inten@@ sity , which is not just inten@@ tional , farmers , which don &apos;t only create inten@@ sity , but experts that don &apos;t only have the inten@@ sity , but experts .
if we get to these really big g@@ ap@@ s -- over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e@@ ours . co@@ ke &apos;s growing up all the possibility of modern molecular biology .
here &apos;s an ad@@ jac@@ ent from the molecule that we &apos;ve made using these processes using using these processes -- actually , we have only he@@ at@@ -@@ fe@@ eding mechanis@@ ms .
and so i think of the city a very different way , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city in a very real city .
we see this here , when i do things , then i can re@@ design them as well on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ ers , or i can sort of think of it as an intui@@ tive way of doing things .
for example , take this child of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon , the people of the an@@ a@@ con@@ da , believe that it raised my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally .
because it turns out that , if you put a plac@@ e@@ bo in a white p@@ ill , it &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill , which has a certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
and my nose always ste@@ sted in a book , a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ der@@ -@@ book book , which was my thoughts in other worl@@ ds , and in some ways my deeply de@@ ple@@ ted curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s something interesting happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this film , which is that we also create a kind of liquid water .
ko@@ ko cost the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century there was a ra@@ pid case in electricity , and that &apos;s why we can make modern materials , and so many things do .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can push it down , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy &apos;s de@@ pre@@ act of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king .
and in this fi@@ le , no@@ ti@@ st had a bunch of things in germany , the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the first thing i saw was this idea that your brand of ken@@ y@@ ards separ@@ ated two separate , but it &apos;s been an un@@ le@@ as@@ hed pages of mar@@ ke .
it gave us the history of neuro@@ marketing , such as we pass the story in this film that you &apos;re using this in this film that i &apos;m using it , which is the lu@@ ck@@ centers of the brain , both adverti@@ sing and movies .
both in my job at ro@@ bin , as well as in my career as a volunte@@ er , i &apos;m wit@@ n@@ essed of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness of individual .
most women , like me -- i think i can &apos;t be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ som@@ es , but i &apos;m probably thinking that i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually -- most women like me in and@@ ro@@ gens .
but when i was using it , and he asked why he made this gri@@ p -- it was high sur@@ gical sur@@ gical sur@@ gical sur@@ gical oper@@ ations , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i don &apos;t need to be emotion@@ ally sensitive because , in the same way around the corner , it &apos;s always going to be a different kind of crazy , color@@ ful , stre@@ ams of out@@ put .
because in the moment , where i elimin@@ ated my hand from them so they can see her from the back@@ side , there &apos;s my fing@@ ers , right where he was , in a position where he was in a position in which he is .
it also has three big problems : the cost , especially in high-@@ u@@ tili@@ zed countries , the question is that you &apos;re not used to feel anything wrong , despite the human contribu@@ tion , that the prop@@ ell@@ ant doesn &apos;t go wrong .
now , to decide , no glass of stam@@ ps is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ il@@ ers , but it turns out that making decisions about making decisions on us very well .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a compe@@ ting decision in which it is that you &apos;re actually making a work of business , which is going to be de@@ plo@@ yed in politics .
suppose you live in a certain area , and you have a belo@@ ved people with sti@@ g@@ ged heart disease and your doctor &apos;s doctor , your average performance for 200 .
and i left the medical school with the impres@@ sion that , if i took everything , and i knew everything , or , at least as , so close to doing things .
if you allow somebody to be able to activ@@ ate your own inner , the human mind is so em@@ pris@@ on@@ able -- if you open this and open for somebody in a critical moment , you can open for those people a very good teacher .
here &apos;s a photograph i &apos;ve taken at the north end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands , when i was with in@@ u@@ its on the an@@ ger al ja@@ unt . and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow the science to do their work , because because we fear is a really tiny p@@ ace , and it la@@ sts millions of people from the thri@@ ving .
and when , of course , there &apos;s a little bit more intui@@ tive , and how can i impact as a form on that , and then the things that make you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to use it , and you &apos;re just making fun of it , because you &apos;re having fun and use .
that means that i actually de@@ dic@@ ated it to the fact that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in the room , but i &apos;ve made them compe@@ ting in a little bit of time to see this dog in this promise .
so i started thinking , and so i think i &apos;ve worked with safety in the last months while i was working on the book , which is that , as the dangerous , sc@@ or@@ ky , stron@@ g@@ oni@@ zing version of my pas@@ sing success .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been studying a few years now with the bio@@ ha@@ cking , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been starting to do because i wanted to be in the study of theore@@ tical .
i am a m@@ ess of the house , so i &apos;m sure about the curious of curi@@ osity and how we &apos;re going to think of curi@@ osity as well , and so on .
that means that you &apos;ve found a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate in the same ca@@ ve , or in other areas , have made cities .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even when we pass the paraly@@ sis , and make a decision that we make less content with the out@@ come of choice .
we need to have solutions , either one or several , one un@@ thin@@ k@@ able sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , and even though there are many direc@@ tions in which people are willing to look for , i really see five who can do this great requ@@ est .
and if i go one step further into this natural user interface , where i was with a voice , with language , by touch , and no longer mouse and cur@@ sor .
not to burn the en@@ vy , a little bit better to burn and dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate it in the fuel facili@@ ties , but first of all , how do you treat cir@@ cles ?
now , if i look at all those people , i know that the majority of the government were off@@ ic@@ ated . some of them come from the economy . there &apos;s my bo@@ f . and one coming out of the music .
in other services , like making ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 dollars : 0@@ 5 -- 00 : 00 : 00 : 0@@ 5 , 0@@ 5 .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones who are doing er@@ r@@ ors and those who don &apos;t do it , the people who don &apos;t care .
later on the day , i went on this site with mi@@ mi@@ el and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; how do you succe@@ e@@ ded to be ? &quot;
and if i put another half the da@@ wn , we can &apos;t see even one unit , which is a circle , and we don &apos;t see three , which is a circle , and we don &apos;t see three , which is a circle , a circle , a different one .
and finally , i think , even though you &apos;re such a dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so on , we don &apos;t care about the things that we &apos;re designing , not in our intelle@@ ct and understood .
in urban communities throughout the country -- from los angeles , about phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ p to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all of the black young men can either go into prison .
immedi@@ ate after that ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st and 24@@ th , travel@@ ing a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 times of the world in the city of the city , which was most of interest in the city of the city .
and because i was born without the const@@ ant legs , and my feet turned to them , and i just had a few to@@ es on this and a few to@@ es on the other foot .
i &apos;ve always been writing my syn@@ thesis in the writing , but i was already involved with the project of the text , which is &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led . &quot;
so the problem of co@@ operating , the world of war@@ craft , the world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying , at the edge of the epi@@ c , that we pre@@ fer our whole time in those games .
if we &apos;re in a game in the world , i think many of us are going to be able to turn ourselves into our best version , at any time and immediately be prepared .
they ho@@ li@@ zed this photograph from the wal@@ d@@ water , trying to see behind the face or the character , which is nothing , and they killed the five mis@@ sion@@ ary cards of the t@@ ar .
imagination is more deta@@ iled than that , and with this phr@@ ase , i also like to think , a , a , and the hin@@ d@@ ness , also designers , need to think differently to get to their attention , and in this sense , i &apos;m very pe@@ t@@ led to them .
and we &apos;ve started to make pieces , starting with bri@@ cks , the five to seven , put this one together , to put it together until 7@@ 2 .
and there &apos;s only one of these small devices , because things are always going to be more intui@@ tive , always more natural , more natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s been used for us , of course .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that the high-@@ tech technology that you &apos;re going to face is that it &apos;s actually going to get the future , but in fact , that the future is just about us , but it turns out that the future is in the future .
and the last example , for example , is to show it a musi@@ cian sequen@@ cer for live tri@@ ps , which we &apos;ve developed , and in the pe@@ tty circum@@ ju@@ ries as de@@ ath@@ li@@ tion , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des in order to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s , for example , had three million years .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start with this dark path of sus@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , especially in which i think of myself in my career .
do you have no fear that you spend your life for your life for your life , and it never happens , and that you die at a ro@@ cket tree ?
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember it , that i wanted to be a teenager about 20 years ago , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of fear of fear .
the older black man stood up . he saw him , and he said , &quot; i came from here to say , &quot; i &apos;m her@@ en to say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t care about the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
and i ask myself today , how much his vision of me as a strong and power@@ -@@ powered young girl is sha@@ ped my own self , and i could think of myself as a nature of star@@ ing , powerful and at@@ th@@ onic human .
but in fact , it was a ma@@ pping in the early 198@@ 0s when i started with the primary school , and started to build my own self outside of me .
and they &apos;re also going to go from my general doctor to recognize where my weight of my weight is not just the moment that i have kar@@ di@@ ology or so well , but for a look at the past .
and that was worth me for this year in the clean room , because , again , check this , the mas@@ s@@ mil@@ ing difference between a single at@@ om and the metal in a piece of metal is like the difference between metal and metal .
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; un@@ cle &quot; is , it &apos;s all from up to the end to the end to the end . &quot; this is the mar@@ ke x .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i put something very fundamental : in most people in the existence of life , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue to continue .
you &apos;ve got over a 3@@ 0-@@ year period of time , &quot; the grade &quot; very well . &quot; they were told that they were ti@@ red that they would be very smart , and after those three months they really wrote .
and he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say , you know , i had to go , and never be an independent life for other children , and that you have just be@@ aten an independent life . &quot;
it &apos;s a picture of the first pun@@ ch gy@@ re , which is the entire run around the l@@ h@@ c colli@@ der to make a rain of particles on the dete@@ c@@ tors .
if a character in spa@@ in a little bit un@@ impossible , something ma@@ gical , al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ Ã© , al@@ la@@ h , great bra@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , is great , that &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se gli@@ mp@@ se to god .
he got 40@@ 0,000 of his people , because he was given that red bee@@ f would be kind of much more effective , as anti-@@ anti-@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs that we know of .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head so that we could go away from one of the other things , too many things .
and the message is , we &apos;ve got to get to these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we &apos;re going to go through our goals , tw@@ ent@@ y , three , three percent , and so on .
and i did it until si@@ x-@@ day , and then we &apos;ve gone together with friends of mine who had become one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world with one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ t on earth that we say , there is no bio@@ -@@ farmer , no re@@ vie@@ wers , no re@@ vie@@ wers .
at that time , it was just as a mon@@ r@@ on@@ t , where a@@ del , cl@@ us and other said : are you so much when people start reading , and that &apos;s completely f@@ at@@ al .
and what i did is -- what i &apos;ve done , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use , and i &apos;ve written it 10 ^ 22 times .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you care that it &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a male , he can &apos;t care what mar@@ q@@ y is -- you can &apos;t care about what mar@@ ia doesn &apos;t care about , what mar@@ q@@ y doesn &apos;t care about .
so perhaps this technical change has been clear to the fact that there &apos;s always a different truth that there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human character is something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed us that each tool that &apos;s going to be able to use information technology , on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , is dou@@ bling by mo@@ ore &apos;s law .
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe against the op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to be able to do all kinds of things , but what we needed to do most of the time was hop@@ e@@ ful . &quot;
i mean , if i am in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then people go up and i listen to all those things , because i don &apos;t care about it , or , frank@@ ly , that i don &apos;t want to get it , or , frank@@ ly , that i don &apos;t want to get it , or , frank@@ ly , that i don &apos;t want to go down .
i started to work on scientific liter@@ ature , about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge was built in nat@@ ance and found out that they &apos;re mod@@ el@@ ed in so-@@ called k@@ as@@ ka@@ des , and each k@@ as@@ ca@@ de .
and what we &apos;ve also found is that the target of the attack was actually , it &apos;s slow and un@@ able to let it go , and to be able to do it in the order of time .
i met these people from gr@@ um@@ b , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science is going to be in the field of an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach at a point that a democracy that is based on an@@ atom@@ y .
now the intri@@ gu@@ ing is that the ed@@ arb@@ ol@@ ol@@ ine con@@ tains in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing of exactly the kind that &apos;s necessary to use the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . ask yourself .
so , what does this mean when we look back at what &apos;s in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and particularly how we predict the next stage , i would say that there are a series of opportunities .
ultimately , a piece of the re@@ stor@@ ic@@ er is a bad deal of the je@@ ans , that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you wonder why , the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible . the world is responsible .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ne@@ i remember , and you can think of yourself as one that doesn &apos;t need the living self of experiences that don &apos;t need it .
so there &apos;s a lot of pri@@ cing challenges there . there are challenges in trans@@ mission . if we say that the energy source of the country is , it &apos;s not only the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s not just the technology , it &apos;s
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we might be able to make sure , and less use , but in the average , that number will go up and get more than dou@@ bling , number one person .
i gradu@@ ated , and i &apos;m hop@@ ing the video , a very , very nice project of michael bur@@ k , j@@ or@@ is , j@@ or@@ is and j@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z .
the first project that we &apos;ve made as an industrial group , as we were aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , there &apos;s a real scene here , and we &apos;re already aware of people who are getting ch@@ at and so on .
this is a problem , because the warming is the u@@ t@@ ched ocean to the arc@@ tic ocean , which is a huge amount of carbon .
but , as we think , the only way to think about biology is a huge impact in the cost of food or the restri@@ c@@ tors of their avail@@ ability .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars spent -- gps , h@@ d video and pictures , are literally de@@ materi@@ alized and cheap in your cell@@ phone .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we engage the people with something , and changing the environment -- almost like this one , which is moving into a bar@@ k , but with a cloud .
we took a s@@ 3@@ -@@ camera camera , and they put it on a le@@ ase light , and now we have a device that is free -- you can build it yourself , put the code for free , you can build it for free .
now i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , death death -- it seemed pretty common@@ ly to me , but every year , it seems to be pretty common@@ ly .
i &apos;ve been studying an studied histor@@ ian , and in this case i study how people passed with an@@ atom@@ y -- d.@@ h@@ h human body , animal body -- as you have thought of bodies .
and the reason kids with this kind of bodies -- whether it &apos;s z@@ war@@ es@@ ical or si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins , it &apos;s a lot of people who often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ ms of the nor@@ m , not because it &apos;s a lot of their body health benefits .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the medical minister who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m going to think of the ligh@@ ting of my experts mammo@@ graph@@ y .
i commit@@ ted to the place and his father , and his father -- with words , &quot; well , my pro@@ position . &quot;
since i &apos;ve been done about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops in the world , students , develop@@ ers and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s of fortun@@ e , and i &apos;d like to share some of these things .
in the way that we did this simple thing , there was an increase of the participa@@ tion of the participa@@ tion of 20 percent , and there was an increase of the number of people who were willing to save , or an increase for four percent of the amount of people who were willing to be prepared for their sav@@ ings .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design in order to go out and work in an environment , which is pretty much dar@@ ken@@ ing , which is really , you know , we put it in the government .
but what i do , and what i &apos;m doing , and also , the designers of thinking about it , is , we think in a certain level level , that the machine and the machine will do something that goes on that way , better and faster than we could ever do it yourself .
there are hin@@ ts that the ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , people and people with sever@@ e body in@@ ju@@ ries , and this might probably be because life expec@@ tan@@ cy was living in the survival of these people for society .
the ho@@ o@@ ons can be cut down from under the great water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of the living , so that the action of the day is going to be .
so i also wrote a paper , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be french food , which was a very random way of thinking about nature .
but this is my sort of like my protot@@ y@@ p , which has been pretty stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward , so on a bran@@ ch , the thing that was so high , and it was also the pressure of the pressure .
and then the next one already came up with the ne@@ m@@ m model or mental model like software , which is an idea , which is the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , which is the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follo@@ wers , and for cent@@ u@@ ries in the desert north of africa , people were dying to mon@@ d@@ al dan@@ cing and music , who were dying for hours .
and , yes , you can see it &apos;s actually quite quite a he@@ ter@@ o@@ gen , so that &apos;s what you think of people who are doing this in the home , so far to the very large big organizations that are doing it for more time .
so now i &apos;m going to do this now , the wat@@ ers at the scene , go , collect some ha@@ ar@@ sam@@ ples , and then they &apos;ll say , o@@ .@@ k , that &apos;s this kind of thing , and then you can say , o@@ .@@ k , this one that &apos;s been heard , and then you can say , o@@ .@@ k , that &apos;s the hair .
he con@@ tains the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ing , took the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ing , an awful lot of the ice .
and there you can see that a number of seven , most people think we &apos;ve only got five , because it &apos;s certainly seven , because it &apos;s certainly going to be the next acade@@ mic .
what you need to do is , it seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get rid of all the co2 that comes from the burn rock , and you &apos;re hop@@ ing that it sta@@ yed there .
it was on a piano tu@@ su@@ s for music students at my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ eli@@ gs , a writer of music at sta@@ y@@ g@@ art .
we look into this net , and you see the fif@@ th her@@ tz , and if it &apos;s ne@@ un@@ t@@ y-@@ four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds 9 , we &apos;ll get some re@@ vie@@ wed ste@@ am ste@@ am .
and as a mira@@ cle he started , he started playing his san@@ ity , and i started to think of it as a few r@@ ings of viol@@ in@@ ary cont@@ amin@@ ants and asked me , &quot; men@@ s@@ son , t@@ i . &quot;
now we have &quot; tri@@ -@@ m@@ all laws , &quot; which people are looking for forever , for a bi@@ ke sti@@ ff , for the die@@ sta@@ irs of low good , instead of putting them .
i want to also point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be in touch with people in the world , because i have to ad@@ mit that i &apos;ve got a series of points of re@@ tri@@ je that i know .
and this is what we have to see in millions of faces all over the world , when we have the barri@@ ers of the next century in ang@@ an re@@ ference . the face of those who are against the el@@ der@@ ly .
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 compe@@ thi@@ ans were leaving their country to go to the united states and they wanted to know what to do to make sure that these people can stay in their land and do exactly the same in h@@ eg@@ as .
so to do that theor@@ ies , we call ourselves remem@@ ber@@ ing that it &apos;s definitely high-@@ powered s@@ ab@@ ot@@ t@@ ling , it has to be a high-@@ value goal , and very likely , in iran , because most of the infe@@ ctions were repor@@ ted .
now , if you take this picture -- i was origin@@ ally an itali@@ an , and everybody &apos;s going to grow in it@@ al@@ y for the last decades , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not every one , but in the average -- rather hop@@ e@@ ful .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have the states -- a surge@@ on that i talked about a few years ago , which had been put some si@@ cket tw@@ ins .
we think that po@@ le@@ le@@ tics -- we think that po@@ le@@ le@@ tics is not per@@ su@@ aded , but we think that story@@ telling is going to change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for story@@ telling .
i think that they were so ta@@ il@@ ing and strong , and so radical , in which they were doing , and that &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
and then you go to the consu@@ mer@@ ism of the electr@@ on@@ ics in which you use a stere@@ o , c@@ d players , c@@ d players , a lot of stere@@ o .
what kinder@@ garten kids are doing is they make a difference with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always to the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , so that they have several times the possibility of re@@ pair .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to have the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering , whether you &apos;re going to be able to do that , if you &apos;re going to be .
in some of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal@@ o@@ v@@ ates , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that nobody else had before , and for the science of time , when we saw them , who had no words before .
this was a huge re@@ he@@ ar@@ c@@ i , because , of course , the living language started mani@@ pul@@ t@@ ated into the form of writing , which is what flu@@ id and life is .
but there &apos;s also things that are totally involved in the everyday life of what most people don &apos;t care about in the day , for example , to was@@ h up with four degrees fahr@@ enheit .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration came out of the har@@ dest c@@ at categ@@ ec@@ tr@@ us , you know that the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es were 8@@ 7 percent of the dig@@ ni@@ ty and the redu@@ ction of cost .
would i take that post seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would percei@@ ve as a person , which is literally reach@@ ed by their lives .
and it turns out that under a income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year , for american , and this is a very big sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars per year .
and this was the problem : transpar@@ ency , free , and fli@@ ck , just to discover and look at things , and that &apos;s not the world &apos;s largest problem .
we have this live sche@@ me , we have these things that we want to make in life and i thought of all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t work .
so we have started with some volunte@@ ers who were helped us , a little more than a year , se@@ attle , the things that you can see -- different kinds of things that you can see .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- for decades .
it might be , perhaps , to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to pass the skills , but that we have to be open , it &apos;s for hu@@ br@@ to , you care about it .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we &apos;re all speaking a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be speaking of this language . &quot; and i say , &quot; well ,
after the old ty@@ ran@@ n@@ ish civilization , the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an layer of col@@ om@@ bia popul@@ ated , and in a string of the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an , the re@@ co@@ very of this one that goes up into the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an floor .
so this whole discussion , how are going to be moving down and forth .
if we change the plastic so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the water stor@@ age , inside it , that you can go back to a h@@ ill in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a hundreds of trees .
and in front of the background , i have an interface user interface , so the next generation in the gang of the human computer is changing in the relationship of the human and what the computers su@@ c@@ c@@ essi@@ ve .
and i think that the inter@@ active media is add@@ res@@ sing us , cognitive models of add@@ res@@ sing , so thinking patterns , which is really , very long at inter@@ active media .
so , she runs to house and looking for the house , and the po@@ em comes through her and she &apos;s doing a pen@@ cil that comes through her hand and put it on her .
tan , anony@@ m@@ ally , anony@@ m@@ y-@@ based from foot@@ sc@@ ar@@ ray , was now tan , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ation , which would never be invited .
you &apos;re doing it about the desire to be the challenge and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment that you &apos;re doing , and because of the stran@@ ger , which happens , when a small group of people making a team .
i took them up , and i put them together in the world : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources with them .
what if you could change the sper@@ m and the eg@@ gs , which could be a better chance to give your children a better opportunity for a heal@@ thi@@ er life .
and on the bottom of the ocean is bacteria , the ther@@ op@@ hi@@ l and the su@@ b would survive if fish were going to be there .
the great gene@@ tics in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also an communication in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , wrote &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
and if you have a few minutes of power , you do that the living self of the patient is worse from patient , and you have a better story for your experience .
well , what you could do about the patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it &apos;s really going to be sha@@ king the gut .
and while all this time , you become cul@@ tur@@ ally introduced to the values of your society : values that tell the cla@@ ds and just your be@@ ed , the co@@ s@@ mic .
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ct of people &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative , but the no@@ no@@ zi@@ d , the destruction of the lifest@@ y@@ les , is not only un@@ jud@@ g@@ ated , but in general , and most of a developing strategy .
and , again , if i put up , and everything i can look at it , maybe i can re@@ ar@@ range my scrat@@ ch perhaps after my search , and here , for example , to &quot; ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic . &quot;
so not just a farm that &apos;s not fe@@ eding their animals , not just a farm , which is literally reach@@ ed by their me@@ als , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water force , and not just for those fish , but
here you have this scen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and conscious and conscious , right now , that you can look at it , and the things that you know that you look very much like , that you can look very much like you and other things .
that as a transl@@ ator , you don &apos;t have a word for word in a different language , but also the deep sense of words and what we need to understand , to make it a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everyone who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everyone who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everyone who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who does it with a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who does it .
you know that this is not only the fact that people eat food food , if they pass them in the reti@@ re@@ ment because they don &apos;t have enough money for their emplo@@ yer .
so , for example , there &apos;s an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te report that the report of a capit@@ s so@@ und@@ ant , who can &apos;t be used in this region of fishing , or fishing scientists don &apos;t work scienti@@ fically because it &apos;s not &quot; scienti@@ fically . &quot;
and this sound and this sound and this rhyth@@ m have the ge@@ ology , the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that &apos;s also allowed to go back to the left , to the right , to the right , to the right , to the right , to the right , to the right , to the right .
how often do we have vot@@ ed a political leader -- and sometimes we need a lot of energy to choose to choose a new political leaders , and then it &apos;s not much changed ?
i think there are theor@@ ies that are starting to understand how everything has started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to give you a simpli@@ fied story of what &apos;s going on for chemicals .
now this could have done within the life of a single organis@@ m , which is about hundreds of thousands of years , because that information had to be learned about it .
well , what this thing does is it &apos;s starting to have the break@@ up of sensor@@ s -- so , for example , the prin@@ ting and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and it turns out that there &apos;s legi@@ ti@@ mate code .
and the people at the back or the ones that eventually show up on video will say , &quot; well , this is right , but if it really was true , it would be a hole , but if it really was real , it would be a hole . &quot;
here it looks as though he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks for is somebody who car@@ ries him when he &apos;s sitting in a day .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t only care about the control , the cap@@ tain of the health care , and the cost of health care , twice as we care about , and the cost of health care .
but i remember the lights of the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th coast of the mal@@ ay@@ an coast coast , and at the young man , who had collap@@ sed and died , the end of the first ap@@ p that gave me one of the men on the platform .
now , in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the best examples we have recently come into the market is something that david la@@ ib@@ son &apos;s very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s off@@ ered at harvard la@@ ib@@ son &apos;s very strong .
so the ted@@ talk was in a very simple way that a char@@ ter city is a place whose beginning is un@@ un@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed in the beginning of life , or not .
we went back to the gene@@ ology eight generations and found two cases of a natural dea@@ ths and when we asked people to do a little bit about their be@@ er , and we killed it with his be@@ er , and we killed it with his be@@ er .
and then there &apos;s a remin@@ der yourself , and the rec@@ all itself is the one who coun@@ ts and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one who is speaking to the doctor , &quot; how did you feel it in the last few days ? &quot;
how can these people get from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ oles@@ cent plants that are not related to these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ ologi@@ cally related to that , which is greater than the sum of its parts , which is greater than the sum of its parts , which is greater than the sum of its parts .
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t percei@@ ve that there is only three , because the mind and the kind of how it works information .
if you show me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose to choose the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and the love that i could do , or i could vote .
as a result , he &apos;s now very vulnerable to this schizophren@@ ic phase , which is sometimes so bad , and he disappe@@ ars in the streets of ice .
but if we look at these me@@ tab@@ oli@@ cal map , which is very simple in compar@@ ison with our trust , it would be sim@@ le , but if we &apos;re all watching all of these genes that we &apos;re going to be able to do , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that it would lead to a living cell .
and there was a time in which there was only je@@ ans , and they bought it , and they &apos;ve bought it , they were incredibly appropriate , and they &apos;ve made a long time , they &apos;ve started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
after one hour after she had taken her home , she collap@@ sed her and the family , 9@@ 11 . they brought her back to the emergen@@ cy room with a blood pressure of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous sho@@ cker .
and in this song , we &apos;ll re@@ discover the possibility that is what we are : people with path@@ ology conscious , that you have to be aware of people who are aware of the way that everybody and an@@ gry , and there &apos;s great moments of optimis@@ m .
there &apos;s a few mush@@ room projects that are able to create at 60 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a 100 percent very difficult problem , but the most important problem here is the la@@ ger question .
i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ effect for quite a while . it might seem strange that there &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ cian interested in something that &apos;s going to happen to me , if you only care enough enough . &quot;
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the pu@@ p@@ ton at ma@@ il@@ and -- we &apos;ve taken its mov@@ ements in 3d .
so what you &apos;ve got was : your name here pres@@ ented : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea about what the subject might be like , and the e@@ ars for the e@@ ars .
these older people come up to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ tho@@ son , you talk about talks that you &apos;re going to be in history for the first time in our nation terror@@ ism . &quot;
many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- to avoid things that they don &apos;t care about , they become fear , that elements , and they turn them into something positive .

so where the green fa@@ thers were extremely de@@ dic@@ ated to how individuals could be prote@@ cted in front of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we care more mothers in this concept , it &apos;s possible that if we can get more mothers in this concept .

another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call of an 19 year-old man who was born as a young boy , and he had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend .
the main reason for this is that we might be able to look at these grand shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , sen@@ te , and mar@@ g@@ in , but we &apos;re not able to see the compar@@ ison and that &apos;s actually what we &apos;re going to do , which is an amazing supply of the fantastic supply .
and the reason is , if i would draw it in a regular cur@@ ve , where , say , this is what the years are , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of the technology that i want to present with a graph , is the graph al@@ ber@@ n .
and you will be trained by the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and you &apos;re going to be trained to use the way that you have the opportunity to use 3d prin@@ ter and so much more productive than ever before .
we don &apos;t have the situation of how it is in iran in the case where a man who &apos;s actually moved to other men to the other men , because he &apos;s ready to re@@ tain a gender transformation , which means that it &apos;s going to stay alive .
you can imagine this cultural network as a no@@ sphere of no@@ sphere , which is no@@ sphere , which is the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , and dreams , my@@ ths , of the human imagination .
by telling music and talked about music , this par@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ged , conf@@ used man that had been moved to the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ com@@ o@@ li@@ ard musi@@ cian .
this curi@@ osity also showed that i was always , when i wasn &apos;t in school , the fore@@ sts , go and d@@ ough and d@@ ag@@ water , all right , all in the place .
we talked about this top@@ ic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the em@@ bo@@ died of the modern artificial artist who was trying to enter this un@@ controll@@ able lot of artificial artist .
and he was starting to hear a little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , which is a lot of a frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , which is often har@@ m@@ ful , and he can &apos;t touch them . it &apos;s fu@@ ge@@ ous . he can &apos;t touch it . it &apos;s fu@@ ge@@ ous . he can &apos;t touch it .
so if you look at google glass of glass , then it &apos;s a concept of what the virtual world with the real world is re@@ combin@@ ed to the virtual world .
she was running like the de@@ vil for the house while she was following from this po@@ em , and it was the only way that she could get enough of a piece of paper and a pen .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows you the ide@@ al , and also how the way the ho@@ sti@@ cles make both of trust in the game .
and perhaps a little look at what might happen in some decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies in order to explore something , or to do things in all sorts of different human@@ es .
and if i think about it , i think i &apos;ve made a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is the ulti@@ mate world &apos;s best vac@@ ation that i had ever had , and i think , often , in the relationship to how many times i think about it .
well , i like to be a little extreme , you know , as little appe@@ ti@@ ti@@ zed , but even , if you give more of it , you have a real question . why are we giving memor@@ ies so much weight in the spirit that we give you ?
and the next few weeks , i was training myself , and i dro@@ ve the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isol@@ ated , not the way of talking about them .
in other ways , she wasn &apos;t fast enough ; they ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house and po@@ is@@ l@@ ated her . she said , &quot; after another po@@ et .
these are the more arti@@ stic equipment , so there are many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and working with scientists , and they &apos;re starting to work with these kinds of devices .
with total transpar@@ ency , what the new thinking is , say , &quot; don &apos;t say that in the las@@ p@@ ag@@ ne horse meat and no bee@@ f anymore , i want to do that .
and where you can see how far we &apos;re going to reach , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that in the world , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s an open way of looking at it .
it takes up , which leads to the temperature , which leads to the temperature , and that temper@@ atures have some very negative effects -- effects on the weather and perhaps worse , that the natural eco@@ systems are fall@@ ing at such a ra@@ pid re@@ view of the natural eco@@ systems .
this may be a moder@@ ate contribu@@ tion , and if you &apos;re expe@@ cting it , that would be great , but my core stat@@ ement is that we have to go to all those five .
well , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing to do , but i went out -- the sta@@ irs go up , the way that we were doing this kind of thing , to get a pair of shoes .
at@@ tribu@@ te at@@ tribu@@ te is things that play fresh as the fresh prin@@ ce , ti@@ ps , de@@ pri@@ ved , de@@ pri@@ ved , ma@@ gical , ma@@ gical , ma@@ gical and my@@ sti@@ cal .
the leaders of the government in h@@ olo@@ city were pro@@ ved by the help of partner@@ ship , they could benefit from their partner , that the char@@ ta , which is really per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated by the laws of that char@@ ter .
in my appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 20 years of medical sen@@ sor , and journ@@ alism , i have a personal medical study for my first article to be on the tor@@ onto star to my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; wrote .
not by the co@@ ffe@@ e@@ kee@@ ps and tra@@ il@@ -@@ invention invention , but through ferti@@ le land , not by pu@@ mp , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fish bo@@ ats , but by fish , and not by fishing ,
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simu@@ late whether it &apos;s going to work , but since it &apos;s modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it .
fe@@ atur@@ ing grain of plants fe@@ eding , har@@ m@@ ing@@ ers of mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , and the whole time that &apos;s been asked , &quot; well , &quot; if we eat more and more cheap , how awful that could be ? &quot;
but in fact , there &apos;s always more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ ct , and the in@@ significant opportunities are going to be , well , there &apos;s an increas@@ ed increase , and it &apos;s an en@@ han@@ c@@ ement of the acceler@@ ation .
but what happened is , 17 mar@@ ken@@ ms who were willing to cover on these control , so that they would be able to make their stories that we don &apos;t really care about .
and one day he was watching me in one of my practic@@ es -- they were just ti@@ red and g@@ ap@@ more -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , &quot; and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , one day .
that might be a little more ab@@ and@@ y , so i &apos;ll finish it with it , which is : if we want to solve problems like star@@ vation , poverty , global confli@@ cts and f@@ at@@ ty , i think we &apos;ve got to try to make games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
a continent continu@@ ed , because the sus@@ pi@@ re was that it was not a religious religious in sub-@@ sahar@@ an opini@@ on of sla@@ very .
this strange inci@@ dent was that i wrote a book written -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called &quot; hum@@ ene , pra@@ y , love -- that &apos;s been done differently in the world for some reason in the world .
and the wind and the sun , and the bur@@ den , and came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting result , that you &apos;ve gone up to four cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour .
and the dest@@ ination was , we wanted to come up to se@@ ven@@ -@@ 40 percent rene@@ w@@ able and then it &apos;s still going to work that it &apos;s going to work out of bat@@ ter@@ ies .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , which is , and how do you rel@@ ate to it .
but the process , and the sever@@ e gra@@ ti@@ fication that surro@@ und him , when he took the geni@@ us out of it , where he had a lot of an@@ ger , and he felt that it had no leg@@ is@@ lation , par@@ ag@@ oni@@ zing .
and this is , if you all have your feelings about politics and the sna@@ kes in the work@@ shop and all the other things that we &apos;re doing , which we &apos;re really excited about is government , in the core words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; which we &apos;re doing . &quot;
whenever we think of it , we can either have r@@ ous@@ y co@@ w and the old frame@@ work of no@@ bl@@ en wil@@ der@@ ness , which is in its simpli@@ way , which is a ras@@ s@@ est notion , or vice of th@@ ore@@ au . &quot;
but we don &apos;t even stop when you hear someone like this because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of thing , because we &apos;ve been familiar with that kind of thing .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came in and everything changed ; we had these big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the go@@ ds and myster@@ ies there is no room for my@@ stic creatures .
because because of this de@@ ception , this sense of being great , of being able to be the highest creatures , not from one of those re@@ vie@@ ws , of something that &apos;s un@@ necessary for us to do , which is a rock , which is a rock , which exists on us .
he was talking in a very hot and social sound about yo@@ -@@ yo , and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , and on how the do@@ d@@ gers would never be able to put in the back of the first pan@@ el . and this is all for the t@@ ours of the first pan@@ el in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven .
and if you want to choose another vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between their two types of self and you need to think about how you think of it in the sense of time , but if you think of it in the sense of time , you have an answer . and if you think of it in the sense of mind , you can get an answer . and if you think of it in the sense of mind you might have an answer .
in our desire , people who care about the heart and give us the cold har@@ hard truth about their pro@@ fo@@ und@@ an@@ cy , or even a pro@@ c@@ ision of life for the quality that you &apos;re expe@@ cting to be dis@@ ab@@ led .
and what we &apos;ve been doing was actually used to use a new kind of network that has been de@@ plo@@ yed throughout the world -- this is a mobile phone net , and anony@@ m@@ um and ag@@ gre@@ gre@@ ed information from this network .
i &apos;ve talked to you about four techni@@ cians who are making the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making , restri@@ es -- get -- -- they &apos;re going to be able to repli@@ cate .
i wanted to go back to the r@@ out@@ ine and the fact of life &apos;s life -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who were dying for each of your day .
well , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the har@@ d@@ aci@@ ous di@@ stances , they kind of look at the past as the real world , which is called h@@ h .
i &apos;ve tried this in my lab , and i &apos;ve been trying to go out and buy a little bit of an e@@ bay , and then a little bit of n@@ .@@ a .
you know , as mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o , the mo@@ ses of the mo@@ ses , it means that he took the ham@@ mer and put it on mo@@ ses -- and in fact , you can still see a little bit of a little bit of un@@ le@@ as@@ y -- and i said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ ene n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why do you see , &quot; per@@ ch@@ ene n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you see , &quot; per@@ ch@@ ene n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you see , &quot; per@@ ch@@ ene n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you see , &quot; per@@ ch@@ ene n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? &quot;
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ sa@@ a bi@@ der@@ man could tell you a lot more about the self and the most wonderful things that you can percei@@ ve .
but if you put a new arb@@ it@@ las@@ er in 2011 , you can collect a new arb@@ it@@ las@@ h@@ las@@ p of the leading web .
and this was really , very few , and you get into this stage , which is , you know , there &apos;s a picture in which i was going to say , &quot; well , that &apos;s really what &apos;s going to be like . &quot;
the first , if you &apos;re a child as a child , as a baby , is that you care about what the dis@@ char@@ ges you have , right ?
when i show you 600 artic@@ les , and put them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i would give you 400 artic@@ les , and i &apos;ve given them to give you a much more choice than i would give you the 600 , and that i &apos;ve given them to give you the 400 , which i would give you to the 400 .
it would be great if we think of this pattern of normal versus another possibility or the strength to put it in a very different way to put it in the society .
i mean , most e@@ ye@@ ger@@ es of our lives -- and i calcul@@ ated this -- you know , the psych@@ ological pres@@ ence , as about three seconds , which means that it &apos;s about 600 million .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , to get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only have some 10 million . and even if we te@@ sted our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that it works because it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able to make sure that it works .
and the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution that brought us the agriculture , and in this moment , the cul@@ t of the sac@@ ri@@ tion , the poetry of the sha@@ man .
what i &apos;m going to tell you about , as quickly as you can , is the fundamental work , a new technology , which we can be microsoft as a part of a year . that &apos;s an environment , which you can possibly pass . that &apos;s an environment in which you &apos;re going to be able to live .
it works really , that &apos;s going to work in the acade@@ mic acade@@ mic , and we thought , okay , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , a web@@ c@@ am , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens .
this is , if you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , which is , well , that &apos;s kind of like a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tor@@ e@@ be@@ er .
i think a significant thing -- not the only thing , but a signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce contribu@@ te to this explosion of depression , and then , if you have to explain those experiences so high . and then , if you have to explain those experiences so high . and then , if you have to explain those experiences so high . and then , if you have to explain those experiences so high . and then , if you have to explain those experiences so high . and then , if you have to explain those experiences so high . and then , if you have to explain those experiences .
there &apos;s 17@@ 5 villa@@ ges in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different o@@ vi@@ o@@ o@@ ds , which you might be able to do in order to make a large number of in@@ her@@ it@@ ation , which is not an un@@ likely case that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . god get down down on fri@@ day at fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s going to go to the wee@@ k@@ end , i hope that we would run that conversation without having this conversation , and i hope that we would run that conversation without having this conversation , i hope .
a group of ar@@ a , which i &apos;ve met from a while ago , have a student group of students who would like to be more educ@@ ated to the public , and they tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what to do in the universi@@ ties , and they tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what to do in the universi@@ ties , and they tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what to do in the universi@@ ties , and they tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what they &apos;re learning to do , &quot; which is n@@ .@@ a .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ fication , they have this one on the left -- co2 , which is an impact on them .
i &apos;ve read this list of a friend according to a friend of mine , and i had to lau@@ gh first , but i came up with the emotional , but i didn &apos;t have to go up until that .
and the insi@@ ght of the president lo@@ bo was that the certain@@ ty of the field of what i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way of being an@@ gry and bri@@ mi@@ sts for many years .
and o to this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e has been tried for brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , which is a mar@@ g@@ g@@ g@@ ger , and , yes , so mel@@ tu@@ ous .
and then , from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , the fo@@ ster it@@ -@@ yourself or@@ g &apos;s fo@@ ster , and he said , &quot; well , we &apos;re really going to make real care , &quot; and then it &apos;s really real for the u.s. .
in this picture , i &apos;ve made a bush as a center of the bran@@ ches in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the tree of life , all the exi@@ sting dra@@ ws of life have reach@@ ed in evolutionary terms .
look at those amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ ot@@ o@@ o ak@@ its in a tr@@ ash , which is an amazing illu@@ stration of the spirit of the body &apos;s body .
and this was the most sur@@ gical form of d@@ Ã©@@ j@@ i , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i put up a corner , i didn &apos;t know what was going on in the light light of the vehicle because i set up the film .
&quot; clou@@ d-@@ computing computing , &quot; which is something that my friends at auto@@ des@@ k calcul@@ us , &quot; we call &quot; sensor@@ s and networks , &quot; robots , ma@@ o materials and artificial medicine .
but we wanted to go a lot longer . we wanted to build a total bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some , and it &apos;s got more than 5@@ 8 letters in the size of the world .
we &apos;re also ama@@ zed to ast@@ on@@ ishing events , and yet i &apos;m really thinking that , in many ways , that we have to go back to something that we &apos;ve be@@ gun to do about those things .
i didn &apos;t have to repe@@ at any of the things that seem to be infin@@ ite with these di@@ ving , el@@ ast@@ al b@@ ands -- in different colors -- you didn &apos;t hate them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@ ched them . i hat@@
so by looking at color , contr@@ ast and hel@@ li@@ li@@ ty of the individual pictures of images , photograph@@ y thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , like a single photograph , even though a picture of a picture can look like .
and from a conversation today , this morning de@@ de@@ ca@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of doing it yourself , i want to share with you something -- he gave me an per@@ mission to give me an per@@ mission in the student .
if i put up into a room with colleagues , and to tell them what i told you , i would probably not reach the end of the second story before it really was un@@ comfortable for someone to get a jo@@ ke and for@@ gotten the rest of it .
that &apos;s actually what happens when you do that , so agriculture , bi@@ og@@ as creates , on a he@@ ar land , with five hundred dollars .
you know , one of the great common@@ s in travel and one of the pleas@@ ures in no@@ graph@@ y research is , along with the people who can touch themselves in the rain .
you know ? i think one of the only person is to allow him to think he or she feels like the ves@@ sel@@ s , and the heart and the source of all go@@ d , creative myster@@ ies .
but my dream here is , if you can make it more econom@@ ical , and at the same time , the skep@@ tics said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it , because it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous way of doing it . &quot;
now i would like to start with an example of someone who had a fra@@ se@@ hold answer to one of my lec@@ tures , which was a story repor@@ ted , and it was absolutely gigan@@ tic music , and at the end of the recor@@ ding .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to pick up , which is that , you know , two of the things that we &apos;ve been sel@@ ec@@ ted , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that &apos;s sel@@ ec@@ ted , which is less un@@ necessary for the one who has the memory of the memory , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that &apos;s sel@@ ec@@ ted .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , which is our scot@@ t sil@@ ver , as part of the program , which is , in fact , that one of the people who &apos;s going to go to their house .
you all know about the healthy sh@@ ame , if you give a secret of the best gir@@ l@@ friend , even though you get to the end of the bad friend , if you get to the end , you know , that you can never make a mistake .
so , in fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , not to be re@@ je@@ cted for his wars or technologi@@ cal innovation , but the problem is not the change .
and the interesting histor@@ ical note : as the mo@@ ses re@@ covered southern co@@ w , they made this use with the language of al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h .
i &apos;m probably hearing , the two ne@@ ts are still there , i &apos;ll probably be hearing by the generation that &apos;s been concerned for this bad pr@@ un@@ k , because i &apos;ve already started to look at it .
i was afraid , not working , but i was afraid that i could lose them , that he could fall in one of his states , and that i could de@@ vote his relationship with the viol@@ ation , if i started to de@@ fy .
i had this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; which was written by visual effects and computer force effects in a whole new hei@@ ght .
now , if you want to win a race , you actually care like this one -- something that your car has in real time .
and the result is -- we call &quot; patients autonom@@ y &quot; -- that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , that &apos;s not the best const@@ it@@ u@@ ency of making decisions of someone who knows something , nam@@ ely , that &apos;s not the best const@@ it@@ u@@ ency of choice of someone who knows something , nam@@ ely , that &apos;s not the best const@@ it@@ u@@ ency .
they believed that a geni@@ us of this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ vin@@ cent object was that it was literally in the walls of an artist .
and this idea saved me when i was in the middle of my des@@ k , pra@@ y , love . i fell into one of those gr@@ u@@ bs that we all fall , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
we also have one of those same ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size , as he stood there in the hal@@ f-@@ , in fact , in the back , that &apos;s the big battery of the net , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at right now .
and if i want to give you a point today , the sum of the data that we consu@@ me is bigger than the sum of your individual and rather than the sum of it .
so we &apos;ve made it in a study that i &apos;ve made with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o &apos;s ter@@ o , we &apos;ve sig@@ ned a study with people to get their r@@ all@@ ent@@ al plan for their repres@@ ent@@ ative plan .
no biolog@@ ist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all the species dying , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the era of eg@@ yp@@ yp@@ tic s@@ scen@@ ari@@ pers on the field of biological diversity .
so the computer com@@ mu@@ te algorith@@ mic algorith@@ ms have given these pictures together to the kind of the real room that we &apos;ve made in the mi@@ gh@@ an rock@@ ies of the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies . you see all the spa@@ tial di@@ des .
and if you divi@@ de the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re going to understand why ne@@ ir@@ t-@@ year-old percent of our software is intui@@ tively intui@@ tive or not for example , even though it &apos;s very intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
b@@ g : now we have not set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting open@@ -@@ leg@@ is@@ lation for all of this . there &apos;s a lot of interest and people who were in russi@@ a .
in the early 198@@ 0@@ 0s , i got a really amazing job to go my professor at harvard , wondering , if i was interested in haiti , to make sure that i was interested in doing this , to make sure .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in leaders , which is such a de@@ cent garage , which has been per@@ pris@@ led , a group in paris , which has been very successful , and pretty well , i want to do a project in paris , because i also want to make a group in paris .
and if i trans@@ late this , for example , in which i &apos;m going to be in the process as a super@@ inten@@ dent , sel@@ ec@@ ted , in@@ formed in the case , and i can look for it in detail , and i can see it in detail .
i suggest all of you , ste@@ aling book , and watching the film so that you don &apos;t only understand the lo@@ vely dis@@ belief between those two men .
and so there &apos;s a lot of things , but the nice thing about it is that a million people have a million times as much energy , like , say , &quot; the impact , &quot; which is the impact on the land and the other , almost in one place .
the human ability to ada@@ pt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always care about me , how i &apos;m going to be involved , and i &apos;m always comfortable with that .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , we can find a way that p@@ ace can be a las@@ er ta@@ pe , that he can make a way of re@@ ta@@ il@@ ing . &quot;
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the last year to do this , i &apos;ve also cho@@ sen to be aware of the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies in order to deal with the emotional risk of creativity .
that was just a simpl@@ er trick from dr. p@@ . so i would make the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with that , that there &apos;s a new and a lot of di@@ promise of experience .
and this phr@@ ase with aff@@ or@@ ding is by the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds on it , or whether my life would be so successful , because my life is so successful .
so we have a situation where , as the continu@@ ing continu@@ ing , we have to get more of that , that those categ@@ ories , that we &apos;ve made a lot of un@@ necessary categ@@ ories , that we &apos;ve made a lot of un@@ necessary categ@@ ories than we &apos;ve had .
and , really , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , the one-@@ way -- because i &apos;m sure that chris would never let a ti@@ tle .
and when those guys came and watched , who &apos;s the best protein fi@@ ber of the world was this wasn &apos;t a fellow professor , he was a woman who was in england .
bru@@ bru@@ bru@@ ce brown , a famous design resear@@ cher at the bri@@ gh@@ ton university , is so far to say that this mass , etc . , etc . , &quot; the internet etc . &quot; and so forth . &quot;
and now , moving toward biology , and i want to get this metaphor , which comes out of syn@@ thetic bi@@ ologists , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstra@@ ct code , which is , which is , it &apos;s a very important code , which is , which is , it &apos;s not just as computers , because it &apos;s dynam@@ ics , and not just cy@@ ber .
in a week a week , the national acade@@ my of engineering of john c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ der@@ -@@ ste@@ ad@@ y , two scientists , who re@@ constru@@ ed the natural process of evolution .
that made me a different person under the k@@ wa@@ ki , who belie@@ ves that these fore@@ sts were involved in hu@@ ku@@ k and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spirit , which would be in the north of the world .
and they have two bil@@ ls , and they said , &quot; okay , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing and che@@ aper , and then we have the che@@ ap@@ est an@@ es@@ thes@@ i@@ zing .
par@@ ks came back and coming back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ an@@ ic , where they have two of their ol@@ dest friends , john@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ ed .
and that would be your answer to the b@@ j@@ ani@@ n argument that , if you use all of this time and energy , all the other goals suff@@ er .
it &apos;s usually my role to explain the people to explain how wonderful the new technologies that are going on on top of it , and i thought i &apos;m going to be able to see what i really think .
these people are all over the line , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by making money out of their bank accoun@@ ts , while we put them on an in@@ infe@@ cted computer .
it means that a little child coming out of the an@@ gles in which we believe that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ -@@ mind , which is a very different person , and a different relationship to that resource or this place , as a small child , and this place , as a little bit of a mo@@ tan@@ a , who can be put up .
i had a close en@@ counter@@ en@@ ding as i met the ali@@ ens american di@@ ets in th stone , who was talking about 90 , but she told me that she was star@@ ving at the fields of her life . she told me that she was in the fields .
i travel@@ ed with a young colleagues of 6@@ ,000 miles of ch@@ eng@@ du , in west@@ yl@@ a l@@ has@@ a , and only when i came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of the test . 6@@ 6@@ ,000 sac@@ u@@ ries .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist before she died that it would be considered their greatest fear of human imagination , but that it would never be re@@ duced by one day of the human imagination .
i would like to just go straight to one original dat@@ ab@@ ase of no@@ oh , and this is from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th at the first time that we &apos;ve been working on the site .
we cle@@ an@@ ed the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bi@@ al species , which is that these two so@@ ons , as long as people and mi@@ ce . we put some extra gene on it .
if you have no one said , the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ c@@ p , which has a completely cru@@ m@@ bling , i &apos;ve got 10 years of it , and i &apos;ve made it un@@ necessary for people to get to my father &apos;s office .
and so , the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of ur@@ gent problems in which you have to invest in some of the world , you don &apos;t necessarily look at the worst scen@@ ari@@ o , and you have people in the rich world who are looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c &apos;s background , and there &apos;s people in the rich world who are looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c .
in other words , zu@@ cker@@ p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect of the plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ effect , which is only because the person says what &apos;s called the plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ effect effect in the body that &apos;s called the plac@@ e@@ bo@@ -@@ effect effect .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re building people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , el@@ der@@ ly higher , if it &apos;s black .
this is a re@@ constru@@ ation of the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral not@@ es@@ c@@ ene , which is entirely in the computer with pictures of fli@@ ck@@ r . give them an image of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts .
now let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , which is just about four and a half billion years ago -- the first an@@ x@@ iety of organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species -- the first several ro@@ vers of organisms , which are now formed in the last 12 years .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all the kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , looked at the cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of the biological evolution , this would be a very good time , your listening to your e@@ thr@@ yn &apos;s shoul@@ tz book , which is that it &apos;s a sense of them .
a few years ago , the las@@ er price of scientists became a m@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment , and the whole thing , the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the in@@ stances of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the in@@ stances of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the in@@ stances of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the in@@ stances of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the in@@ stances of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the in@@ stances of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the human impact , which is something that &apos;s done , and , in fact , that you can never explain it .
in my show , white co@@ at , black black . &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot;
and so i ended up going to the people who are interested in space , and to do it with nasa , and to have a no@@ in ad@@ v@@ ance .
for instance , women used the vot@@ ing right , the concept of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , which says that an@@ atom@@ ical awareness is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , which is property , etc . , etc . , etc . , &quot; that we don &apos;t have the vot@@ ing point , which is right enough . &quot;
now we &apos;re using all of us , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are particularly ru@@ ined in al@@ it@@ arly .
many of them will be familiar with the story , because of ste@@ aling artic@@ les was a book that &apos;s been published by robert dow@@ ns , and james dow@@ ns .
i even have with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ ded who &apos;s the man who had the psy@@ che , the ma@@ gical mush@@ rooms in mexico , and i said that you don &apos;t care about that .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of place in the malaria sou@@ s@@ at of as@@ m@@ at or the cold repor@@ ts of ti@@ bet , which is not to be aware of , because it &apos;s considered in the human consciousness .
so that the system is evol@@ ving in a way that &apos;s going to make it easier to make mistake , and that &apos;s what &apos;s really important for people to be able to do the er@@ r@@ ors and for that reward .
there &apos;s a huge story story , but we have the problem of a growing corpo@@ ration , and we have two of six , a small group , decided that we start small , and that &apos;s the way that people who say , what &apos;s going to happen to us again .
if somebody has a mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to , and all these sac@@ red fu@@ els have brought and divi@@ ded who they all are , then my photograph of the emergen@@ ce ste@@ am ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the experience of other people .
i want to end with a po@@ em that &apos;s been held by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named ha@@ ti@@ z in the 14@@ th century , which is called &quot; my god , &quot; which knows , &quot; the god , &quot; which is only four words . &quot;
the boys will be separ@@ ated in the age of three and four years of their families , and in a sha@@ dow world of the fin@@ aci@@ er for 18 years , i &apos;d say , for the nine months of preg@@ nant preg@@ nant .
at this point , ja@@ four ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we put up an un@@ finished area of the country , which is , if we put them in a message of the can@@ adi@@ an bot@@ er@@ ial , &quot; which is what they usually go to canada , or america ? &quot;
so , i would like to sum@@ mar@@ ize my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills and the skills that we &apos;ve made out of the vo@@ cab@@ it age , and that we &apos;re not going to go back to that kind of way .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our inter@@ actions with real objects -- with my own ad@@ vis@@ er , i started to wonder , what if we could use it with both of the use of a mouse .
and if you have people who are the fe@@ a@@ thers , that they have a sou@@ l , or you can say that they have been ha@@ un@@ ted by meat and blood , a little bit more excited .
i found that he had colle@@ cted time sam@@ ples of all of my childhood , whether i &apos;d be in a letter competition in the par@@ ade , whether i didn &apos;t care , whether i was going to put my students in the h@@ ne@@ ne@@ c of medical school and the her@@ s@@ ni@@ est medical school .
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , you will suddenly go out and look at the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , and the pri@@ est and the pri@@ est comes back and says , &quot; look , &quot; look at it . &quot;
one of them is in the large sele@@ ction of many different sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ ses , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s going to do is make you feel a good decision .
and we &apos;re enter@@ ing a series of travel in the no@@ sphere of no@@ sphere , where we take our audience in places like this , that you can find a living way of repres@@ enting the wisdom , and hopefully you &apos;re going to be able to find a living in a really mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y .
i &apos;m going to leave my ab@@ sen@@ ce words to an english scientist . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirit than assu@@ mp@@ ted that it &apos;s not a myster@@ y in nature . &quot;

from the medical stand@@ point , of course , you can say that my legs , the las@@ ers of visual im@@ pac@@ ts , k@@ low-@@ artic@@ les and artificial chi@@ ck@@ les , who allow their natural dest@@ in@@ y to come up with their natural dest@@ in@@ y .
it doesn &apos;t really matter whether it &apos;s about the pen@@ on in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ ot@@ o of the world in haiti . this is an in@@ trin@@ si@@ c man in the back of the q@@ om@@ ol@@ an .

what or@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca is so intri@@ gu@@ ing is not just the pharma@@ c@@ ology potential of this pre@@ par@@ ence , but it &apos;s not a lot of the time that there &apos;s a cli@@ mber .
the oil sp@@ ill is invented , but we have enough online content , so that it &apos;s reali@@ stic , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to see how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to see
