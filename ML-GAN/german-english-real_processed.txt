Thank you .
Pretty simple .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , yeah .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Woo !
That &amp; apos ; s true .
60,000 .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Come on .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &amp; apos ; s about that .
Thank you .
Positive .
Ol√© !
Maybe not .
Thank you .
One ?
Thank you .
Sustainable .
Seriously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Fine .
Thank you .
This is true .
It sucks .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &amp; apos ; s 1.5 million .
A whole lot .
Thank you .
I &amp; apos ; m tom .
I don &amp; apos ; t know .
I can help .
We lose them .
Oh , my god !
Yeah . Okay .
Not yet .
Thank you .
No hospital .
Are they all ?
Thank you .
We roll it down .
Solar technology is ...
Three out of 10 .
Oh , my god .
We love entertainment .
We love innovation .
Seattle ...
What does that mean ?
This is not ...
Home ?
We were poor .
What does that mean ?
That was incredible .
It &amp; apos ; s interesting .
After a week .
The only chance .
Long , yeah .
As a language .
Yeah , so .
But it goes .
Didn &amp; apos ; t happen .
You need time .
That &amp; apos ; s continuing quick .
That &amp; apos ; s wrong .
Great , right ?
Yeah .
The sun walks up .
That &amp; apos ; s the sing .
That &amp; apos ; s hard .
What &amp; apos ; s great ?
Ta-da !
That was us .
A few less .
And he says ...
We know this .
Sounds good ?
Here it is .
It &amp; apos ; s terrible .
I don &amp; apos ; t know .
Thank you . Thank you .
Stop twice .
Stephen watts .
You could see manhattan .
It &amp; apos ; s generic .
So where do we go ?
Here &amp; apos ; s the video .
You can go inside .
I was facing him .
They &amp; apos ; re all important .
So they knew everything .
It has sensors .
I have a question .
I was amazed .
That would be okay .
Ban is blank .
It &amp; apos ; s essential .
But you know what ?
They don &amp; apos ; t sit around .
Well , the one .
Yeah , i know .
How do we know that ?
Very different term .
So they do this .
How do you care about that .
There &amp; apos ; s no ordinary one .
So it &amp; apos ; s true .
This is very good .
There are a few more .
He opens the door .
Why not live longer ?
Do you see it .
It &amp; apos ; s not a country .
There &amp; apos ; s 1,000 , very good .
So she was back .
Here &amp; apos ; s an example .
What do these people need ?
Hey , why not ?
It doesn &amp; apos ; t work .
I thought about it .
But i was working on .
Or bombs .
And they did .
And i worked on .
What happened here ?
This is what we do today .
I don &amp; apos ; t think that .
Why do we do it ?
Okay . Thank you .
And this is important .
What happened here ?
Centers were built up .
I don &amp; apos ; t know .
Oh , wait a minute .
So how does it work ?
So they meet al .
I think that &amp; apos ; s interesting .
They use their hands .
There are two ways .
They regarded them again .
I &amp; apos ; m going into this .
You know what ?
Thank you very much .
And it has to go back .
It &amp; apos ; s wonderful ?
This is our present .
Yeah , millions seconds .
I want to tell you .
We can do it differently .
They have similar principles .
It &amp; apos ; s completely inefficient .
What are media today ?
This is efficient .
All environmental debate .
Not school administration .
What do you say ?
Why does this happen ?
We can do that .
Do your job .
Good work ! Yes !
What do you want to do ?
Thank you very much .
This was the result .
Can we change it ?
This is all about .
This is the last .
Yeah , that goes .
Flying cat .
So let &amp; apos ; s watch .
Yeah , good afternoon .
That &amp; apos ; s it .
Not toxic inside it .
These days are over .
This is a wish .
It &amp; apos ; s a crisis .
That was fascinating .
Thank you .
We need energy .
That &amp; apos ; s great .
Can i be honest ?
Bg : Thank you .
They blow . &amp; quot ;
It sounds familiar , what ?
What was the result ?
But you know what ?
Not very often happening .
And i was artists .
Pretty good , right ?
This is the system .
What a fish .
You can see it immediately .
There &amp; apos ; s nothing happening there .
Yeah , good afternoon .
This is already true .
To slow , slowly .
Robert gorpta .
The farm is unbelievable .
Not very sustainable .
Let &amp; apos ; s name it .
That &amp; apos ; s me .
What did you do ?
These people make money .
It really enjoyed him .
Here you can see it now .
Will it have my height ?
Am i going to do the color ?
Thank you very much .
Good afternoon , everybody together .
Here you can see the city .
So what happened then ?
Who are these relatives ?
His name is tempte .
And they did it very , very famously .
I had a good life .
It feels great .
You can see the water coming .
Oh , thank you .
It &amp; apos ; s an almost identical structure .
Conflicts of creativity emerge creativity .
I think rather than that .
That sounds crazy , right ?
The game is by 2007 .
I come to the end .
I want to ask you something .
Thank you .
But it &amp; apos ; s even worse .
Be a mentor .
Or is it perhaps possible ?
Some did come and go .
Maybe 10 times as many .
I wanted to keep you healthy .
I swear it .
And it got even better .
That &amp; apos ; s not true for emotion .
After just one journey .
My gut feeling again .
This is what the graph looks like .
There were remixes .
And then it became international .
Hh .
It &amp; apos ; s my grandfather .
What do i look at ?
Okay , some more .
Is it all about photography ?
Is it all about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Here &amp; apos ; s another example .
There &amp; apos ; s something else .
Let me wrap up .
There &amp; apos ; s an old study .
Yeah . All right .
This is a great question .
Jk : Both .
Put the camera out .
This is the short census .
This is a great question .
It stops you fresh .
Is this your opinion ?
First of all , narrows .
My name is amit .
I grew up in india .
Just continuing a lot of fun .
And the answer to that is no .
I made one .
It sounds bad .
Well , what does that mean ?
Dk : 60,000 .
But this is not protection .
Luckily , yes ?
That &amp; apos ; s not going to do it .
Does anyone see something particular ?
You need to understand it .
Pee a chance .
You can &amp; apos ; t have bones .
They didn &amp; apos ; t have mass media .
They didn &amp; apos ; t have books .
Isn &amp; apos ; t that sad ?
So we &amp; apos ; re too many .
But where are we useful ?
In china , it was different .
But the wrong thing .
We &amp; apos ; re not producing yourself .
You &amp; apos ; re comparing comparison .
And i &amp; apos ; ve always had .
Why not think about that ?
Very expensive moties .
Here &amp; apos ; s another example .
They even hurt .
Why should we do that ?
I &amp; apos ; m a writer .
This is what most people here .
How do we actually work people ?
Don &amp; apos ; t be haunted .
That &amp; apos ; s felix .
... his own story .
You can see that there .
Thank you for listening .
The work of the interpretation .
So what does that mean ?
People were mad .
The data came in .
We need to spread the message .
And that &amp; apos ; s pretty amazing .
What happens now ?
And i understand that .
Why is this ?
Who will make sure ?
We first have the population .
It &amp; apos ; s paul offd .
I agree with them .
They don &amp; apos ; t want to do that ?
Yeah , here it is .
But it didn &amp; apos ; t .
So what do we need to do ?
He had had the experience .
What has to be done ?
That &amp; apos ; s excitable .
It &amp; apos ; s against justice .
I mean the soul .
What is the soul ?
I can argue anything .
We were twenty people .
I wonder .
An enormous challenge challenge .
We also call it skeptical .
But what do you eat ?
There is no food .
I don &amp; apos ; t like this question .
That &amp; apos ; s really cool . &amp; quot ;
Do you see those guys ?
I actually did two errors .
And then it happened again .
Crisis . Death .
Maybe that &amp; apos ; s true .
And a lot of people forget this .
He &amp; apos ; s the guy on the left .
And so did it .
I felt really good .
He went up and down .
It would be confused .
He was always showing here .
And luckily , he didn &amp; apos ; t .
It was still fish .
We have three primary groups .
There are online crime .
Privacy has to be there .
What can we do ?
You look like this .
We love technology and creativity .
We have lost .
I perpetuated kids .
It has billions of them .
But what do we do ?
And this opens up a map .
I will never forget .
I will never forget that .
I was destroyed by the ground .
It &amp; apos ; s about something .
It would be unlemorable .
The only country in the world .
I think that &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
I think that &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
It &amp; apos ; s not the problem .
It &amp; apos ; s not our struggle .
We &amp; apos ; re constantly moving together .
I &amp; apos ; ll stop it .
So they feel good . &amp; quot ;
It works like this .
Because here &amp; apos ; s a masses here ?
And that &amp; apos ; s actually what he says .
So paul is a terrorist .
Nobody has said this before .
The data is all the time .
Don &amp; apos ; t take anything for granted .
I mean , i &amp; apos ; m a journalist .
But the defining thing is ...
And the shape plays role .
Everybody talks about happiness today .
Here &amp; apos ; s a surprise .
You don &amp; apos ; t have the story changed .
Very scary .
It &amp; apos ; s a completely different term .
How should our testimony look like ?
This has the largest impact .
So they saw something magical .
That &amp; apos ; s why i made the movie .
What lessons do we learned ?
So it &amp; apos ; s a huge challenge .
That &amp; apos ; s a lot of volume .
And finally , epiky means .
The same thing , just bigger .
You don &amp; apos ; t care about other things .
It was a huge success .
And then to realize it .
Who is the most successful ?
So this is the good news .
They have so much uncertainty .
They want to be feeding the world ?
The data hadn &amp; apos ; t available available .
The whole building was made of water .
In the morning , before the game .
First of the time , second .
Italy wins . Yeah .
They saw the great impact .
And then all of them went down .
But i don &amp; apos ; t buy anything new .
Play is not align .
You can get those cloud .
You can play with different types of games .
Let me get accompanied .
This is about five feet long .
That was the beginning of the journey .
They &amp; apos ; re going to become computers in the free .
&amp; quot ; He said .
How many people would choose creativity ?
How about fitness ?
This is the exciting thing .
So we can .
Let &amp; apos ; s be honest -- who is normal ?
I wanted to get normal .
What would you most like ?
They create an epic story .
Play is not just kids .
Is this all about education ?
Now how did that happen ?
These changes are coming .
And this was 19 years ago .
Well , i was the next one .
The creativity had to get out .
Let &amp; apos ; s go to it . &amp; quot ;
I can &amp; apos ; t use it .
It should work .
So it &amp; apos ; s &amp; apos ; n circle .
So now you &amp; apos ; re hacking ?
What &amp; apos ; s actually happened ?
This is a game for outside .
For example , this perception in context .
Does anyone know what this is ?
They really loved it .
This is what happened for santa .
Then i can transmit this .
You can &amp; apos ; t store energy .
We depend on two countries .
And that &amp; apos ; s what we do .
And we are too many of them .
The orange tractor .
So , not like detox .
So let me remind you .
Everyone needs a fish glass .
The answer is &amp; quot ; no . &amp; quot ;
It &amp; apos ; s all easy to have .
Answer is &amp; quot ; yes . &amp; quot ;
But i felt worse .
They could do better .
Right now , when it &amp; apos ; s the waste .
That &amp; apos ; s god , you know ?
Okay , that really matters .
So , you know .
Is that common-sense ?
So the question is : How ?
What is this ?
Everybody &amp; apos ; s falling away .
I wouldn &amp; apos ; t recommend it .
And of course it &amp; apos ; s incredible talks .
I only loved two .
It &amp; apos ; s not really technical .
They say , why ?
Can &amp; apos ; t be a problem at all .
And here &amp; apos ; s the theme .
And then they put up .
Thank you for your attention .
And already you have a problem .
&amp; quot ; Of course , &amp; quot ; i said .
It &amp; apos ; s almost nothing left .
It doesn &amp; apos ; t work very well .
I wanted to support them .
To one , great .
There &amp; apos ; s four and a half thousand people living .
He showed up on the algae .
This is an autistic student .
We can &amp; apos ; t just do that .
You can train them .
It wasn &amp; apos ; t invented yet .
How did that feel ?
It will always be more like the same .
My wife told me .
Do it curious ?
Again , you &amp; apos ; ve got it again .
Now there &amp; apos ; s a third sentence .
Because i can say anything .
And we &amp; apos ; re very happy about this .
It didn &amp; apos ; t have that soul .
This is such a science thing .
She did it for three years .
Sometimes i go too much .
I talk a lot about these questions .
We all love baseball , right ?
The white lines represent the population .
Let &amp; apos ; s talk about hydrowars wars .
And there &amp; apos ; s good news .
That was granted .
Once the judge saw me .
So i went to court .
It doesn &amp; apos ; t work , right ?
What are you trying to do ? &amp; quot ;
But , you know what ?
It &amp; apos ; s not our citizens .
Today it &amp; apos ; s 2.3 million .
I should probably not .
I &amp; apos ; m going to give you something .
We use the energy energy of the sun .
Do the kids do no longer .
I got a fear of technology .
And there are hundreds of them .
But they do the job .
And it starts with a doctor .
And is the crux .
I don &amp; apos ; t need to worry about it !
So we started a vivity .
People still were happy .
It was my first sunrise .
Actually , he did fish .
My name is brian goldman .
It divides your experiences with others .
So what is the next step ?
We can &amp; apos ; t get rid of it .
And it &amp; apos ; s a 257 .
But there are two problems .
I started to feel better .
Slowly , slowly , it took it .
She was back and dying .
The nurse asked the nurse .
My second mistake was worse .
I learned everything .
That made me really sad .
But it was very sad .
I see this bust sign .
What other brands do ?
And that &amp; apos ; s what we did .
Basically , they do the same thing .
They come from artificial artists .
That &amp; apos ; s not what i should say .
I &amp; apos ; m going to show you this now .
This is all the metadates .
This is one of the images .
The two were calling me .
And it took 18 months .
We were in an area .
Tell me about the world .
Lever technology .
This is risky .
That would not have a problem at all .
The power plant can explode .
That &amp; apos ; s cool , right ?
And that worked very well .
And again , it showed him jazz .
And then something funny happened .
Her mother was going on her way .
The story isn &amp; apos ; t over .
But that &amp; apos ; s not that fast .
And this doesn &amp; apos ; t tell a lot about us .
It dawns these two people .
And that &amp; apos ; s not at all .
Maybe even in mobile phones , perhaps even in mobile phones .
How can we help you ? &amp; quot ;
Sometimes the perspective is an illusion .
That &amp; apos ; s not what we &amp; apos ; re going to do .
No one have been a way .
This is from this place .
It &amp; apos ; s very simple .
What happened that day ?
Well , let &amp; apos ; s do it .
Okay , there are some .
It &amp; apos ; s all important opportunities . &amp; quot ;
Think of your own decisions .
One place is south korea .
And it was an amazing experience .
Next , nuclear power .
This is a pretty crazy idea .
I could draw . I could paint .
So the dynamics became really changed .
Today , 6.8 billion people live .
We have something that isn &amp; apos ; t rising .
For energy , this is one .
Now i see greg lemond .
There &amp; apos ; s a billion people who are starving at you .
Definitely we need a solution .
There &amp; apos ; s another reason .
Architects and engineers , luck .
I was trying something interesting .
There &amp; apos ; s also a world record .
I stop , thank you very much .
And everybody in this room needs to be there .
And then we said , okay .
Very simple , so that &amp; apos ; s going to come .
He &amp; apos ; s going to the right thoughts .
That &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s called the project lacks .
It &amp; apos ; s busy to make sense of sound .
Yeah , these are the data .
How far can you possibly do anything ?
And that brought me through this ...
Do that for kids ? &amp; quot ;
So i just started playing .
Music is medicine . It changes us .
In the assumption of maybe two percent .
I loved myself from this fish .
It floods the channels .
And this can make a huge difference .
So he &amp; apos ; s perfectly in the middle .
What about longevity ?
But what will happen in the future ?
Five million people use it every month .
But that does not be the end .
So this crazy story could vote .
We &amp; apos ; ve been doing it since 1994 .
Students are divided by grades .
If you haven &amp; apos ; t heard it yet .
That &amp; apos ; s not necessarily something bad .
We have a kind of counter-balance .
Who does not want to be healtated ?
These are going to be uncontained .
I remember my first fire .
And you know what i &amp; apos ; ve learned ?
Happy productivity . Fantastic !
And here they are .
And the objective of this is very simple .
I think the knife in my hand .
Dark urine . Dark .
This is ideology , not science .
This has nothing to do with science .
So , look at what happens .
I &amp; apos ; m going back to my slease .
The result of that was disorders .
They &amp; apos ; re just better than the reality .
And this is a very simple question .
What is it called a story ?
So the correlation corresponds .
No , i mean really seriously .
Then we get this whole positive feedback .
So the natural things are presented .
The living immigrants of the spirit .
These things are logical correctly .
The question is , what &amp; apos ; s next ?
So , in the third hand , we &amp; apos ; ve forgotten .
And this is really at the beginning .
I want to show you this .
Anyway , to navigate .
The book and the image .
Let &amp; apos ; s do a little intersection .
Already , for longer than those other two networks .
Here he leaves the sun .
I don &amp; apos ; t know who recognizes what recognizes .
Does anyone know what three seconds ?
It &amp; apos ; s a very exciting phenomenon .
What does this mean for designers ?
And it depends on phosphorus .
Was a pretty good project .
There &amp; apos ; s leukemia in kids .
We started this 15 years ago .
Sunlight and co2 is a methodfold .
We &amp; apos ; ve read about millions of times .
A has these advantages and risks .
And there are several reasons for this .
Do you want jeans with holes ?
The truth is more like this .
That &amp; apos ; s completely overall .
Great ! This machine is pretty noisy .
I think it makes you laugh .
These rivers can take a ride .
This is the memory of memory .
This is a picture reminded on something .
Let &amp; apos ; s leave it away .
You can &amp; apos ; t have any teeth .
You can &amp; apos ; t do anything .
So the first step to interpretation .
You know what it is ?
Because for me , it means memory .
He was already talking about sixties .
And it &amp; apos ; s always not an interpretation .
It &amp; apos ; s like learning to learn .
And this sounds very different from the time .
And what does it figure out ?
The reasons it &amp; apos ; s writing it .
You &amp; apos ; ve already been talking ?
Let me get something through the head .
No , no , no , no , that &amp; apos ; s not .
It &amp; apos ; s interested in firefire .
It melted up .
It has to be the objective difference .
Here you have this little mechanism .
Asking questions , what is the right ?
In how we think about north .
Zertate missions , yes ?
So you can &amp; apos ; t solve it .
We can remove our nutrients .
But we need that overall .
But very effectively , it turns out , yes ?
For people over the urine .
I started an institute .
We &amp; apos ; re in germany sustainability .
That &amp; apos ; s the minimal .
You can show me , i was there .
If you come to this , yeah ?
We can reinvent anything again .
It turns out it &amp; apos ; s really hard .
I &amp; apos ; ve learned this from my grandmother .
This is perhaps going to be transferred .
It can know where we are .
I talked a lot about magic .
This is the apthea .
I tried to understand them .
My brother stared at me .
All of these generations need a few milliseconds seconds .
We &amp; apos ; ve run a lot of things already .
This is a very sensitive question .
We don &amp; apos ; t really know very much about it .
Now we &amp; apos ; re going to do it with airplanes .
I started with my usual talk .
Oh , my time is already over ?
They didn &amp; apos ; t give up government .
Who would ever be one wish ?
But it requires a lot of planning .
And this morning i go on .
I think there are ways .
It &amp; apos ; s continuing rapidly .
This gave them an evolutionary advantage .
We don &amp; apos ; t have the app .
How do i get it away ? &amp; quot ;
And these are the neural structures .
We don &amp; apos ; t like to talk about our history .
Her dad just died after her birth .
Bjann sundin .
They sell certificate .
They were genetically engineered .
It won &amp; apos ; t be documented .
And nobody seems to break up .
I &amp; apos ; m the defining doctor .
And his response was &amp; quot ; yes . &amp; quot ;
I don &amp; apos ; t take the same thing .
I don &amp; apos ; t have anything to hide . &amp; quot ;
Privacy is not debattled .
Lego made it all possible .
It &amp; apos ; s all about changing industries .
For a year , we had no ending .
Because we &amp; apos ; re living on a water planet .
But i &amp; apos ; m going to ask you a question .
But perhaps this is not the case .
We actually redefined poverty .
&amp; quot ; Risk is not a simple game .
They &amp; apos ; re an inspiring personality .
Baseball is full of great statistics .
The other had strong breakthrough .
They gave their blood pressure up .
Her family replied .
Why did i go into medicine ?
It would have been too easy .
Do we really want to go into that direction ?
I went to prison -- hard .
We need to think about what marks .
That did not make sense in my eyes .
This is frightening .
Okay , you really want to know ?
That sounds freesty .
That was more to emphasian .
And i had to go out of the city .
What else is risky ?
We &amp; apos ; re a smaller brand .
What would you describe ?
This is a child &amp; apos ; s game , right ?
I really like to make beautiful clothes .
You can do that all the time .
And this video is real time .
I describe that the root tiger .
Just be , who you are .
The game begins -- silence .
I like things that are different .
But the truth is far away .
We &amp; apos ; ve won a couple of prices .
It can only use his eyes .
What are you going to do about it ? &amp; quot ;
Isn &amp; apos ; t that overwhelming ?
Mmmmm , my brand ?
Will it be less than 20 dollars ?
Here &amp; apos ; s a description of the road .
We need to grow complexity slowly .
They even bring financial services with them .
Here &amp; apos ; s the olive oil .
Here &amp; apos ; s your marker reporting .
Well , that &amp; apos ; s not quite right .
Who do you actually care about ?
So we measured its movement .
Oh my god . Oh my god .
Who could seem to anticipate this ?
All the adults were aware of the risks .
That &amp; apos ; s more than 250 thousand acres .
Slightly lower in me .
Thank you , but the best thing is .
But then you really want to go deep down .
It &amp; apos ; s extremely good .
The film hasn &amp; apos ; t been implemented .
They want to go into the museum ?
Thank you very much .
You see a funny thing here .
This is a picture of the object .
It seems very popular .
It &amp; apos ; s got to experience the experience .
And i &amp; apos ; ve never seen it .
Stones are fattered .
There &amp; apos ; s a lot of things that have to come together .
What exercises me ?
What do you do about the waste ?
There &amp; apos ; s also underlying these sources .
That solves the fur problem .
It should contain the two elements .
There are lots of great books on this subject .
It &amp; apos ; s great that this number goes up .
It &amp; apos ; s still continuing .
If that doesn &amp; apos ; t work , what ?
That &amp; apos ; s just a insurance method .
And lingborg is thinking .
You can predict the future . Why is this happening ?
They run the process , they understand him .
So this is a tough nose .
They &amp; apos ; re gone . They &amp; apos ; re gone .
&amp; quot ; This is success , &amp; quot ; he said .
Silence ? I was completely confused .
&amp; quot ; The best part of the industry . &amp; quot ;
The chef had it cook .
And ecologically it was a disaster .
You &amp; apos ; ve got literally put up the lever .
I &amp; apos ; m an experte on relationships . &amp; quot ;
Does anyone know what this is ?
There &amp; apos ; s no half or a half ? &amp; quot ;
He shooted his head , no .
This is an ecological network .
How are you going to feed the world ? &amp; quot ;
It was truly profound .
So what can we do from all this ?
There was never a time before this .
That &amp; apos ; s going to happen in the next april .
This is &amp; quot ; world without oil . &amp; quot ;
What do you think happens next ?
That &amp; apos ; s what we get a absolutely flat line .
Thank you , danny kahneman .
And there &amp; apos ; s hunt employees .
So the first exciting prime prime .
This is the truth . I believe .
Thank you . I have a question for you .
He had 20 minutes of glory music .
I &amp; apos ; ll tell you the insights .
But it &amp; apos ; s not just words .
Widritionality is just to our lives .
We can give ourselves a little bit of ourselves .
It &amp; apos ; s a reduction in the image .
Daniel kahneman : Sure .
We &amp; apos ; ve also got a very accurate data .
We don &amp; apos ; t want companies to have seeds .
And why ? Developing food food .
We &amp; apos ; re going to talk about it differently .
This guy in the middle not so much .
We have now massers in this country now .
It &amp; apos ; s cruel to millions of people .
They &amp; apos ; ve got them . They &amp; apos ; ve always got them .
It &amp; apos ; s not even the truth to get rid of them .
Everyone would like to make us happier .
Because we don &amp; apos ; t want to go around ?
So he &amp; apos ; s here . Right .
So the sitering is a role .
Well , i &amp; apos ; ll show you .
What does this look like ? Pretty good .
I hope you excuse me .
We &amp; apos ; re running out of initiation rituals .
And here you can see the whole thing again .
And that &amp; apos ; s what you &amp; apos ; re doing .
But i &amp; apos ; ll get to you again .
But we start to see change .
This is one part of you .
It &amp; apos ; s about a new care of america .
We need to come far , and it &amp; apos ; s fast .
That sounds basically an unusual case .
It just wasn &amp; apos ; t , you know ?
And this picture was recorded by atlas .
No , no , no , no , no .
I want to tell you a little bit about this for a minute .
Maybe again , a look behind it .
So from the modern era in computer society .
To say , what is information ?
This is a annual diving river .
Dalmatian dog , right .
Yeah . She doesn &amp; apos ; t care anything other than discover .
This is my supermarket . No big deal .
They drill each other .
This level of intuition is very important .
They &amp; apos ; re the hot countries of somebody .
156 nations send back to the television channel .
Now let &amp; apos ; s get something else .
And then , again , look at it .
We have thousands of organisms that can do this .
In other areas , the world of communication .
These are mobile phones of the future .
They &amp; apos ; re all starting questions .
It &amp; apos ; s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We have unique elements here .
You look at the backgrounds .
Language is expression of the human spirit .
The mechanism comes out of the lies .
Behind the seven mountains and so forth .
So basically , translation of translation .
This is such a comintuitive part .
His personal impressions of the erotic .
Most of all , when he died .
Tell them what they find .
So there are two circles of circles .
In two hours , they make it all over the place .
A particularly beautiful story , as i say .
And then he can run away .
Because now you can use a three-sentence .
Do it even from school .
In this three-sentence , three sentences .
That &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s been labeled .
You make it kite .
Shh the environment , go less waste .
This is just a little less falling .
It has to be first working as a present .
So , what takes five milliseconds ?
This is another paradigm shift .
I try this through an example .
And the curiosity of curiosity don &amp; apos ; t care .
I see the dalmatian dog .
But with the real design , there we go .
So , you can &amp; apos ; t have men a pig .
No tree is carbon neutral .
We can support them to be good .
The byproduct is clean water .
We can support them to be good .
It cost 2.7 billion dollars .
She was the daughter of a slave family .
This country is unlike 40 years ago .
So it &amp; apos ; s got a recrupt replacement .
They were inspired by us .
It can know how to think about it .
We &amp; apos ; ve seen some fantastic representation .
Next step happened within these communities .
My cousin everywhere drifted around .
Something very strange here .
Many of my students are very young .
I perpetuated people in the death cells .
I think our identity is threatened .
It will touch them deeply .
Guide maybe some mutations .
I said , &amp; quot ; i will listen . &amp; quot ;
We were working late late the night .
I believed everybody could do this .
He died , broken by the history .
I never met him personally .
I lived in parallel space .
So i followed my gut feeling .
I &amp; apos ; ve learned some very simple things .
&amp; quot ; They didn &amp; apos ; t let you go . &amp; quot ;
Boston didn &amp; apos ; t have a call center .
The waterfront is from another place .
It may be , until it &amp; apos ; s loaded .
This is a modest little app .
So scott get this fruit .
Do you want to get there and listen ? &amp; quot ;
Somebody made an old-fashioned version of this .
She wasn &amp; apos ; t drowned .
You lose fewer and fewer animals .
What you need is a new medical culture .
I &amp; apos ; m a man . I make errors .
It was a grouky .
They tend to grow up to five centimeters .
This is the system that we live in .
The difference is then perceived as a loss .
Alone , shine and no support .
But western governments are also helping themselves .
But today , we &amp; apos ; re far beyond that .
You tap your internet connection .
It &amp; apos ; s a choice between freedom and control .
Sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
Even cats look at this video .
&amp; quot ; A pale dot . &amp; quot ;
So this was a problem for supercomputers .
You should also ask them what wishes .
That i wrote this crazy thing .
We live in a really extraordinary time .
Now look at this curve .
I &amp; apos ; m going to get tired , as we all .
What are those three billion people going to bring ?
But i was interested in these questions .
We expect some remarkable decades .
Maybe i did it with good reasons .
The emergency room was all moved .
And that was what i felt .
He was moving back to silence .
The main man winds me .
And that was the breakoff .
Normal people are not available to us . &amp; quot ;
The roof was also covered in water .
Here you can see how the building works .
Here you can see roberto dancing .
As artists , i &amp; apos ; m really interested in the association .
You see the timeline static .
Mt is fully paralyzed .
And anyway , italy won &amp; apos ; t gather the end .
No insurance can be made .
Thank you so much , that was incredible .
It comes out of all of your own pockets .
Do it -- you all here .
So this is the reason for this project .
Two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
They had a concept of blue blood .
States of those kinds of lives don &amp; apos ; t exist .
But the game is a form-changing .
We &amp; apos ; ll come back to those people later .
We don &amp; apos ; t know why this happens .
In many cases these people are completely healthy .
That &amp; apos ; s not the route .
And women arguing that .
Let &amp; apos ; s start with this .
I mean , what am i going to find today ?
Let &amp; apos ; s start with sunday .
Let me tell you a little bit about this .
It &amp; apos ; s called &amp; quot ; leaf with me . &amp; quot ;
This is a painting of a circle of a circle .
Look at what she does .
Now we saw the reverse effect .
Now , who is willing for this journey .
I think that &amp; apos ; s really cool .
There &amp; apos ; s another aspect of the story .
You &amp; apos ; ve applaud all the applause .
I have here on my laptop . &amp; quot ;
You can be logical and intuitively .
And i want to read to you the presence .
I &amp; apos ; m going to negotiate directly into the artists .
Here are two different jewelers .
I didn &amp; apos ; t really want to do any viral video .
He just wanted to share one bow .
He had uploaded a lot of conservations .
Let &amp; apos ; s think about the atoms .
There &amp; apos ; s jimmy kimmy .
So ... does it mean not as optimistic .
And it &amp; apos ; s also very risky .
At a certain objective of course .
By the way , that &amp; apos ; s just the operator .
I &amp; apos ; m a redundant person .
The goal of the film is transparency .
It &amp; apos ; s switched down the engine .
No , that was what i thought was .
Tell me a little bit about this piece .
There &amp; apos ; s a whole dish whistp of food .
We &amp; apos ; re talking about cool , fresh .
How would you describe your brand ?
They have brought their pictures , yes ?
So littingits is open .
It &amp; apos ; s all over here . It &amp; apos ; s all up .
You can immerse in a particular year .
It &amp; apos ; s great , but i was in love .
How is the fur production ? &amp; quot ;
Tomorrow , you fly 240 miles to farm .
And every night , you fly 240 miles back .
Let &amp; apos ; s look at the ecological model .
It &amp; apos ; s kind of sheting us in a sense .
&amp; quot ; Great , &amp; quot ; i said .
You can jump directly into one particular output .
I &amp; apos ; m going to vote the issue of government .
We &amp; apos ; re talking about &amp; quot ; drowine in information . &amp; quot ;
I was totally excited about , you know .
I didn &amp; apos ; t meet myself .
It was still more delivery .
They live with chemosynthesis .
And yes , i &amp; apos ; m going again .
And then it looks like this .
Picasso says , wait .
So she &amp; apos ; s supposed to come from the outside to people .
I raised it in a particularly way .
These sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
Say , there &amp; apos ; s no predicters .
It &amp; apos ; s the most powerful human feature .
&amp; quot ; Sustainable proteins &amp; quot ; he said .
It was easy to say , okay .
This has nobody in the world .
So naturally , it offers smartleneans .
So smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
And in time , you can respond to another .
So that really blew my mind .
Can you also play me in blue ?
We &amp; apos ; re very technological foods .
You know that science is not a company .
And they &amp; apos ; re not only going to be dead at maspery .
Why do we do it ? Why do we do it ?
And you know what ? They &amp; apos ; re wrong .
We get rid of what didn &amp; apos ; t work .
I have to say that i don &amp; apos ; t understand .
They were just like the people in this room .
We have them compelled . Pop pink .
Shame . Shame .
It &amp; apos ; s kind of like a potatoon .
In the back , somebody who has no childhood had a childhood .
What ? That made me skip .
I &amp; apos ; m really sorry . Make it crazy ?
What happened is that we could do that .
Do you remember the wind ?
That &amp; apos ; s going to be a key element of this sphere .
We need to use it for more research spills .
If you burn coal : No .
If you burn natural gas : No .
The internet and its service is a miracle .
The last three of the five , i put together .
And there &amp; apos ; s a stewardship problem .
This has to go down to zero , zero .
My parents are 80 on the throws .
You &amp; apos ; re hoping that we don &amp; apos ; t need it .
They don &amp; apos ; t invest time fighting .
What do you think about these design students ?
Do we have a machine here .
My grandparents kept up to 70 .
Now the instruments have moved .
You only hear them and start talking .
So each concert is another concert .
Oh , jesus , what a thought !
That &amp; apos ; s going to be rolled on the land .
This is the machine below gene .
And they had to remove what we did .
They &amp; apos ; re all back on their way back .
Seriously -- the undergang is going to be labeled .
Yeah , i &amp; apos ; m afraid of all these things .
This is the primary mechanism of evolution here .
The new chromosome went into the cell .
If you don &amp; apos ; t , somebody else .
And this is great , because we need this .
And if you don &amp; apos ; t , tanks still have your dance .
It &amp; apos ; s labeled in red .
So , the hydrogen has bigger .
It becomes a challenge for 9 .
I start with some simple examples .
I could park directly in front of my house . &amp; quot ;
Well , this cartoon does some say .
That &amp; apos ; s the launch dogma of what ?
So that &amp; apos ; s how supermarket is .
We don &amp; apos ; t defend identity , we make them .
But here &amp; apos ; s what you should think .
Here &amp; apos ; s a few on the hamptoks .
Now i &amp; apos ; m putting a bass up there .
We have only signed signed .
Third : Escalation of expectations .
Your problem is that you have too little .
They care about that .
We &amp; apos ; ve always tried to ask more questions .
They laughed more than her here .
So , for example , america is new .
And the problem is not the technology .
Imagine mozart efficiency .
There &amp; apos ; s every footprint there .
Shh the environment , consulless energy .
And all of this is packaged or content .
That &amp; apos ; s going to happen in china in a second .
Because that &amp; apos ; s kind of clear , right ?
Or take a lipper .
And there &amp; apos ; s a central point .
I &amp; apos ; ve eaten all the time already .
So not saving , you know , avoid avoidance .
For example , the sneaker , yes ?
No , we lay out what &amp; apos ; s inside it .
It &amp; apos ; s all in it , it &amp; apos ; s useful .
All of this is compatible of it .
The phosphorus problem is a lot of critical .
So , help me help me a little bit .
And the last two are still here today .
Definitely , that you do it .
I &amp; apos ; m happy to me that i am .
So , that was my prime motivation .
And the list you can go on .
What are they actually archamic models now ?
Now , if you want to think a little bit more about it .
Now i &amp; apos ; m going to do something more about this .
This is called the osit-model model .
At the beginning , the tribal society is the language of language .
That the theme of ecology is a global .
Now everybody &amp; apos ; s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
Now you see the dalmatian dog .
That &amp; apos ; s actually how the norm happens .
Let me show you a little bit about .
There had to be another piece of puzzle .
Life had not changed for centuries .
Well , it was friday , that &amp; apos ; s true .
Nobody needs to give their ideas green light .
My grandmother never ignored me his life .
But so many people were going to help us over the years .
I didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about anything .
My fourth technology : Required to complexity .
The third technology : Categorization .
My mother decided a few minutes after this .
My mother asked us to touch her hand .
But it has an unexpected manability .
And yet , there is a realistic level .
Is it all about the details or colors ?
Engines -- four ways .
After that , it &amp; apos ; s about the combination of different images .
Now i &amp; apos ; m going to show you my favorite function .
That &amp; apos ; s the point . Thank you .
But i &amp; apos ; m going to focus on the forefront .
You come up to two ways -- very simple .
You &amp; apos ; re going around and amused .
You can zoom in and zoom in .
But the best thing is , in a second .
And here &amp; apos ; s how every piece of course is planned .
I think maybe i &amp; apos ; ve heard more hands .
This would be something that is completely intuitive .
I mean nobody has ever seen one particle .
The rest of the time is delocalized .
It feeds a thousand square miles .
So the theme of the day : Financial saving .
Let me show you a simple simple example .
The first is a classic , apple .
Then i ask myself : How could that happen ?
He came up to me and embraced me .
But we seem to seem to be satisfied with it .
There are some high-tech developments .
We create new tensions and conflicts .
We want to do something against the death penalty company .
In my work , i learned very simple things .
I said , &amp; quot ; okay , oma . &amp; quot ;
First of all , i thought this was a game .
Then he picked me into ohr .
And i have to say , there was force .
Well , i came to the court room .
Here &amp; apos ; s the opportunity to do something to do .
What would you tell somebody who believes ?
I said , &amp; quot ; what are you talking about ? &amp; quot ;
It &amp; apos ; s like i want to be .
That is that our contribution to the system is .
We &amp; apos ; re more than that , we &amp; apos ; re citizens .
Next week , this is coming up on the market .
We &amp; apos ; ve been asking them , and nobody knew it .
I work in the solar engineering industry .
Now there &amp; apos ; s a lot of people who gave government government .
Scott adapted to human .
It has a button .
My mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
All the people who were so , starting to divide .
And try and do this again with another generation .
We &amp; apos ; re in the middle of this transition .
I started to illustrate books at 16 .
The storytelling has always taken more sense .
It hasn &amp; apos ; t come out in any other countries .
Now i would take the needle out .
Eeeee ! No , thank you .
That &amp; apos ; s about one percent of the population .
So they &amp; apos ; re going to go on ; they get the shoes .
We &amp; apos ; ve been here for about 1150,000 years .
I tried to preserve the body .
I wanted to recover the health after a disease .
It &amp; apos ; s not the test of survival and success .
That &amp; apos ; s not just a crazy idea .
Come on with me . Thank you .
Teachers didn &amp; apos ; t know anything that changed .
Ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
So two pairs , each one is a baby .
Now think of it for a second .
In many different forms of time , in many different forms .
They &amp; apos ; re in the back part of the body .
Raise your hands . Let me see .
I &amp; apos ; m not sure where we &amp; apos ; re going .
But it &amp; apos ; s definitely not an optic situation .
People were dying . People fought .
And let &amp; apos ; s start with an example .
Thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
It was almost the imagination of the imagination .
This is a problem that many players have .
I get this feedback in the real world .
That &amp; apos ; s why i think we need to be leaders .
And of course , it &amp; apos ; s about click .
What we want to do is create the future .
This is not a lot of trouble .
And i say that &amp; apos ; s good .
Maybe we can see what &amp; apos ; s going to look like .
It was summer and i had shops .
So we have this horrible idea .
There &amp; apos ; s a lot of luck covers .
You just need to pass it as far as you can .
What do you think the answer ?
I didn &amp; apos ; t want to go ; i love my life .
So that made sense together , it adapted together .
So again , that adapted really well .
So this is where we need digital security systems .
And what i &amp; apos ; m talking about is really important .
Think of an airplane as well .
It was something that we knew .
I didn &amp; apos ; t want to do something about the film .
Actually , that was not the mistake at all .
There &amp; apos ; s a positive effect .
And this is a million-based concern .
They &amp; apos ; re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
I never want to move more into life .
Man 3 : I &amp; apos ; m the museum type .
But reality is always unpredictable .
I want to show you something very first .
Donthday : Self-trust is the key .
And i &amp; apos ; m going to be able to summarize it for you .
It came out and a half years ago in italy .
The summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
Second two days . End of normal play .
Monday : Color is something more powerful .
And we need a lot to do about this device .
It &amp; apos ; s called the cloud -- the cloud .
This is something that is built in the city .
On the left-hand side you see a little boat .
That &amp; apos ; s how they communicate -- so they walk along their fingers .
So i spoke a few months later .
And there &amp; apos ; s also a very good reason for this .
This is alfred gonzalez .
And this arguments don &amp; apos ; t make sense .
I thought i could integrate integrated .
It can give you a order of changes .
The question is , why people accept it .
It &amp; apos ; s supporting other people &amp; apos ; s mistakes .
What do you do ?
The three words loud : Do you remember ?
It &amp; apos ; s not a decision between privacy and safety .
Let me show you how they work .
You can &amp; apos ; t put them wrong .
We &amp; apos ; re still thinking , you &amp; apos ; re originally .
And we increase our expectations continuing continuing continuing continuing continuing .
It was a lot of us , and i put in eggs .
It &amp; apos ; s a game that is called a message .
It &amp; apos ; s the average achiever of your sleep .
It &amp; apos ; s connected to oxygen and silicon rates .
We think of energy scorcity .
I call them &amp; quot ; the income billion . &amp; quot ;
Notice two things in this curve .
And this is really important in medical research .
And i would go back to work .
You know how you call a 42,000 names ?
I put them up and made me into the treatment .
I remember thinking about it yesterday .
And we want to make this material available for all available .
Probably one of those figures has to come from zero to zero .
In each of these five areas , we need to be at least 100 people .
Why do i do it ? What does it take ? &amp; quot ;
These blocks don &amp; apos ; t give us money .
There &amp; apos ; s a connection , another respect .
I think the first point is the curiosity of curiosity .
I &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
And so i came up with a slightly more unusual decision .
And this i found a lot of excitement .
The engine is the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
Let &amp; apos ; s think about how we should measure our success .
It &amp; apos ; s really important that we get there .
The problem here is , here is something like aids .
Marshmallow has to be up .
So this was a highly strange experience .
Now they figured out the benefit of the prototyping .
I had a relationship with this beauty of multiple months .
I can &amp; apos ; t do it , but this guy can .
We &amp; apos ; ve already had twenty percent in germany .
Those were the very first calculations of six years ago .
Is it great , then we have a business model .
There &amp; apos ; s also a whole lot of studies now .
For nathaniel , music is an embound health .
I &amp; apos ; m not part of this group , i have to say .
So basically , my two passions .
You &amp; apos ; ve got the flow of the earth back .
I mean , you &amp; apos ; ve never seen anything like this .
The flamingos eaten the garshes .
It &amp; apos ; s really old , and it &amp; apos ; s done .
You &amp; apos ; re doing something that is actually a bit differently .
I thought , let &amp; apos ; s get the poems in the field .
Because this person actually carries about hard .
And they say , what happens to these moments ?
There seems to be an indulgency to give .
Probably many of you here in the room have this trick .
There &amp; apos ; s a role to play that too .
But now you can &amp; apos ; t count my fingers , right ?
The people in the edges are now coming in .
But one of them is much worse than the other .
They need it , and we don &amp; apos ; t give it to them .
This investment in africa over the last 30 years .
Well , would you choose the same vacation ?
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
This is not about how happy a person is alive .
That &amp; apos ; s a little bit of an epimoran victim .
You expect an additional billion of them in the next decade .
Definitely . That &amp; apos ; s what i want to do .
The logic doesn &amp; apos ; t say about reality .
So we &amp; apos ; re going away , and where are we going to go ?
And i have all kinds of little props here .
But you know what they don &amp; apos ; t care about right ?
Well , i understand that . This is what i do .
This guy was a hero , jonas salk .
Why ? Because paul has made a vaccine .
Do you have all their vitamine ?
Think about it . This is an amazing fact .
It &amp; apos ; s right , morality patents .
There were no cantal-melting melting .
We &amp; apos ; ve made it in the last 11,000 thousand years .
And some of it works , and it doesn &amp; apos ; t work .
We don &amp; apos ; t care that companies have patented pats .
Yeah , they &amp; apos ; re right . Let &amp; apos ; s raise it .
And the question is , why don &amp; apos ; t you have anymore ?
We &amp; apos ; re all born . We bring kids to the world .
We can continue those things in different examples .
Now he &amp; apos ; s running a tractor into the scene .
I can make the conclusion on them .
In fact , coal is not messy .
And they feel as much their movements and tendency .
Here &amp; apos ; s another couple of people who are testing it .
So , for example , they were building blocks .
We wanted to develop a lesson for learning learning .
This is a completely uncomfortable development patterns .
If your job is dancing , dancing .
So , what is biohacking ?
This should actually not be a joke at all , but .
Well , what do we do ?
It &amp; apos ; s the reality of the reality , and it &amp; apos ; s not computers .
Or they didn &amp; apos ; t have a camera tograph graph .
They seem to have seen it in the news .
And in this head , the memory was playing .
And the world in which we saw looked like this .
Everyone in my manhattan is gone .
And we can navigate in this very simple way .
I &amp; apos ; m very grateful for the reception here .
If you want to build it hyperlinks between images .
Now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
And we &amp; apos ; re so often inventing ourselves as we want to do .
From the age age to the age age , the age age .
I &amp; apos ; ve probably got another 40 years in me .
I wear jeans , almost all the time .
But actually don &amp; apos ; t get a bad thing to do .
That &amp; apos ; s a little bit of a dusty of six seconds .
It has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
So we commit about 50 of the magnets .
The only thing that had happened was your head .
There are ones that are much more spatial .
A phrase with his own breath .
But maybe you can also vote them together .
It &amp; apos ; s sort of a behavior operating inside print .
Have a nice concrete example of this .
And i said , in my youth , i said , expectations .
Because the notes are the only bond directly to him .
Interpretation is hardly spoke in the early class .
Everywhere these wind rings , almost close .
Technical cycle gives rise to the same .
Why don &amp; apos ; t i have to do this small car ?
He &amp; apos ; s not really deceiving them and not yourself .
Because without those livelids can &amp; apos ; t live .
So , we can &amp; apos ; t do those things .
Do that , and then you get the phrase .
In the countries where people get to money .
We actually know that something else is the case .
The first question is , are we really too plentiful ?
That means that we need to get phosphorus back .
This is a game i &amp; apos ; ve got to say .
We &amp; apos ; ve figured that weather global .
What &amp; apos ; s actually going to look like ?
Information is every difference that makes a difference .
I don &amp; apos ; t know who you know of this picture .
What remains us is the first thing to do .
But we &amp; apos ; re only talking about the biological systems .
And we see that it goes through .

Yeah , that &amp; apos ; s a huge debate right now , because we don &amp; apos ; t care , or gathers , because that &amp; apos ; s not what we &amp; apos ; re talking about , or gathers , because that &amp; apos ; s not .
In fact , from a new point , we have digitized biology , and now we &amp; apos ; re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by putting up new lives .
And i was amazed at the resistance of what &amp; apos ; s the most effective measure in health care in human history .
But this is what keefites me at night -- one of the things that keeps me stopping at night -- we &amp; apos ; ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , still never .

And this is what i see as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists , that need a good fraction of logic to put the complex ideas together .
And it turns out that when you do it , it &amp; apos ; s a very good tool , it &amp; apos ; s a very good tool to get people to save more .
So we &amp; apos ; re not just responsible for people to preserve the ones that we love , but they pretend to be good at that .

So now it &amp; apos ; s too far , and for those of those who weren &amp; apos ; t there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment ever since -- 27 miles in diameter .
We have now , from our discoveries across the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
And i &amp; apos ; ve argued that we might be able to be a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new species of drugs on this digital design .
In each step we &amp; apos ; ve made these pieces in the articule that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what you &amp; apos ; re going to see in a minute .

And because they &amp; apos ; re physically working as we do , because they &amp; apos ; re only three to six months , they live in their weight of the energy consumption .
We &amp; apos ; ve only managed to have two years of phosphorus and already through the phosphor-mining world , much more uranized in the environment than all the annual facilities .
So , instead of having us to remember , we have standardized , commonly common , in crowds of memories that we can relate to our personal memories .
And then we have a d.v.d burning , and the burning of the laser spends the laser , and then she tries to focus on this camera .
They also go into this kind of artistic sense of biological materials , and , yes , also electrongbing , and combines it in some way .
Food , which has been a chef or a chef , it has to be eaten , and not just looked at it or receptives .
